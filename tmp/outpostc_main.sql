Everything you could think to ask for in a new home is provided for you at Outpost. You can enjoy evening meals with fellow members in a fully stocked kitchen boasting stainless steel appliances, tables large enough to seat eight people, and routinely restocked kitchen essentials and dish soap. Set up for a weekend binge in the (co)living room where Netflix is available on the large 55&rdquo; TV, and get to work in the coworking space where you can print, scan, and fax. If you ever find yourself in need of a little peace and quiet, or feel the opposite desire and want to host a huge barbecue, this house has the perfect scenic rooftop and spacious backyard outfitted with tables and chairs for whatever quiet moment or fun get-together you desire.

I think it attracts a particular type of person - usually quite creative and nomadic types.</p>\r\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t know anyone in New York when I first arrived. It&rsquo;s a city with so much opportunity, full of people pursuing their dreams, and I wanted to be amongst that. Outpost seemed like the perfect way to transition into it and meet like minded people.</p>\r\n<h4>What\'s one thing you\'re going to miss the most when you leave Outpost?</h4>\r\n<p>The people, of course. I&rsquo;ve met some amazing people who will be friends for a long time to come.</p>\r\n<h4>Do you have a favorite spot in the city? or one place you want to explore more?</h4>\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t make me choose! I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time exploring Brooklyn and I&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface. I need to take more time to actually explore Manhattan!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Are there any ways that coliving has helped you accomplish more of what you want to do in the city? or helped you find new passions or interests?</h4>\r\n<p>Coliving has definitely helped me find people that have similar hobbies to me, so it&rsquo;s meant I&rsquo;ve had friends to bounce ideas off, and go out on photography walks and all that. It&rsquo;s helped reignite a few old hobbies and interests too, like video.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Recently, Lee has been collaborating with others in the Outpost community to launch an innovative video series on LinkedIn!

<!--StartFragment-->Thanksgiving Day has deep roots in the history of many countries.

We might come from all over the world, but we are one big community.&nbsp;The Bedford house is big (14 members in all) &nbsp;so we needed a really big turkey&hellip; 21 pounds, and it needs 5 hours in the oven!</p>\r\n<p>When my friends first invited me to spend Thanksgiving with them for the first time a couple of years ago, I jumped at the opportunity. It\'s one of the major holidays in the USA, a day celebrated with family and friends. I\'ve always been fascinated by it because back in Europe we don\'t have a day like it. That&rsquo;s a real advantage to living in a place like Outpost is that you can experience great moments like this shared celebration.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Thanksgiving party at Outpost Club Coliving (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/thanksgiving-party-at-outpost/outpost%2Bbedford%2Bthanksgiving%2Bdariia.jpgoutpost%2Bbedford%2Bthanksgiving%2Bdariia.jpeg\" alt=\"Thanksgiving party at Outpost Club Coliving (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<p>I\'ve asked Americans about the history of this wonderful day, and no one seemed to know the know story. \"Pilgrims and Native Americans ate a meal together once.\" they\'d tell me. So I did some research on the subject and here\'s what i\'ve found: the history of Thanksgiving is pretty inspiring. When the first European settlers arrived in America in 1620, they nearly died of starvation. But the Native Americans gave them food, taught them to hunt and showed them how to grow corn. Everyone was so grateful that they held a big feast together to offer thanks. Almost 400 years later, American families still meet to celebrate what they&rsquo;re thankful for by sharing a traditional meal.</p>\r\n<p>The values behind Thanksgiving are very close to those of Thanksgiving - spending time together, sharing, conversation, and mutual respect.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Thanksgiving party at Outpost Club Coliving (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/thanksgiving-party-at-outpost/outpost%2Bclub%2Bbedford%2Bthanksgiving.jpgoutpost%2Bclub%2Bbedford%2Bthanksgiving.jpeg\" alt=\"Thanksgiving party at Outpost Club Coliving (Image-3)\" /></p>\r\n<p>I found out very quickly that you need to start the preparations for thanksgiving well in advance.&nbsp;So the preparations for this holiday started by buying the famous turkey and all the ingredients needed to make a delicious meal. All the cooking was done at Outpost\'s Bedford House, and it was very helpful to have all the necessary appliances on hands to cook food for 15 people! On this day,&nbsp;everyone got up very early to prepare a tasty dinner. The Americans told meit changes from state to state when you start eating;&nbsp;some start around noon, others late afternoon.&nbsp; We started around 4pm and we had a very traditional meal with turkey, gravy (you can <a href=\"https://mykingcook.com/how-to-make-gravy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">find excellent recipes here</a>), cranberry sauce, and stuffing.</p>\r\n<p>It was great to have people coming from both Outpost Houses &ndash; Flatbush House and Bedford House - and spend that lovely evening with family and friends. &nbsp;</p>', 'outpost_club_bedford_thanksgiving_all.jpgoutpost_club_bedford_thanksgiving_all.jpeg', 1, '2016-11-29 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

The house has 14 bedrooms, and four main common areas, allowing members to explore different parts of the house.</p>\r\n<p>The house&rsquo;s design is the result of the things we learned when opening our previous houses&rdquo; said Sergii Starostin, Outpost Club Partner and CEO. &ldquo;We learned that we needed to entice members of separate floors to interact with one another. It takes a lot more than a house to create a community; if the interior design is right, it can facilitate interactions that might not have happened otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>Coliving is a relatively new concept for New York renters and coliving operators, so each house&rsquo;s design is an experiment in the use of space.</p>\r\n<p>Each common area has a different purpose in this house.

For many professionals, it is the chance to extend their personal network, or engage in team building in new environment. For some, coliving takes on a more personal tone. It can be a chance to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristine-scotto/the-importance-of-worklif_b_10128144.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reinstate balance</a>&nbsp;to a busy work schedule, or a moment to cultivate new relationships through sharing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Workers today are questioning the rhyme and reason behind work more than ever before. Younger generations have had to embrace change and thus quickly adapt to less than perfect economic circumstances. But, the need for rapid change has seen various positive outcomes, such as the development of a booming global coworking scene and more recently, coliving.</p>\r\n<p>As the concept of collaboration over competition has become more commonplace, there is now a global community of professionals who wouldn&rsquo;t do it any other way. This flexible and imaginative workforce is looking to test the boundaries of the modern workforce, and open to sharing more than just a desk. Rather than just <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/what-do-millennials-really-want-at-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">working for the weekend</a>, workers want to bring the joys of the weekend into the workplace. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Not just fun and games</h2>\r\n<p>Many digital nomads swear by their time <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">out of the office</a>. Those who are permitted to work remotely can now turn to coworking and coliving when they need to step away from their routine. Our very human need to change scenery every once in awhile is no longer only associated with lack of commitment, but rather it&rsquo;s associated with <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/05/why-people-thrive-in-coworking-spaces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">workplace wellbeing and productivity</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While coliving may seem like a vacation at first, many spaces are set-up for those who need to get things done. Platforms like <a href=\"https://www.roam.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roam</a>, a startup that has a global network of coliving spaces, encourages productivity by offering members fully equipped workspace in a homey environment. Digital nomads, entrepreneurs and companies can choose from a variety of locations without having to stress about logistics. In fact, one of the reasons coliving spaces have become so popular is because they provide high quality and reliable workspaces so members can relax and focus on their experience without having to worry about whether or not they can connect to Wifi.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Places like <a href=\"http://www.hackerparadise.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hacker Paradise</a>&nbsp;know how important work is, but they also value time off. Taking care of logistics, like accommodation, functional workspace and community curation, the Hacker Paradise team allows participants to focus on getting to know one another and creating room for fruitful collaborations flow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Live together, grow together</h2>\r\n<p><img title=\"Why Coliving? Live, work and play with like-minded people. (Source Coliving.com) (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Why%20Coliving/Source_coliving.jpg\" alt=\"Why Coliving?

(Source Coliving.com) (Image-1)\" /></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.freepik.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Designed by jcomp / Freepik</a></p>\r\n<p>Ready or not, joining a coliving space is immediately becoming a part of a vibrant community. Luckily, those who are new to coliving can expect that their housemates are also there for a similar reason. No matter the reason for coliving, the movement attracts a certain type of personality, one that is curious, open and ready for a change. Through common understanding, coliving spaces are home to ready-made communities. For those who have been on the road alone for a while they can ease their loneliness by joining a coliving space. In the case of companies which work closely together, meeting new people and forming potential partnerships can be an enriching professional experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As everyone has different needs, coliving spaces are designed to offer various programs, workshops, and activities. In addition, many spaces have a set of guidelines&nbsp;that they expect participants to follow. House rules can help participants get the most out of their experience, as there is a sense of order and clarity that colivers can abide by. One of the benefits of coliving is having the chance to grow by learning how others live. By making sure that that basics are covered, like designated quiet hours and cleanliness, keeps members from having unnecessary disagreements.</p>\r\n<p>While coliving is not for everyone, &nbsp;it&rsquo;s important to remember even those who are not outwardly social can still greatly benefit (and enjoy) the experience of living with others. For those who might prefer to spend their time alone, coliving can be a wonderful way learn in a new moment and throughout their everyday lives. Whether extroverted or introverted, colivers can benefit from each other\'s&rsquo; differences, which is a great life lesson no matter where you are in your career or personal life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Understanding play as a form of productivity</h2>\r\n<p>The way of the working world in countries that have undergone an Industrial Revolution is often focused on getting a job that will pay the bills until you retire. Added pressure comes from being made to feel that you need to love what you do. The combination creates a one size fits all model for success, which let&rsquo;s face it, doesn&rsquo;t really work. The rise of precarious work has led workers to question the path to success. For example, financial incentives are no longer the only way to keep workers happy, but rather allowing them to <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/05/co-living-shared-collective-accommodation-housing-millennials-trend-common-wework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">enjoy </a>is key.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A very large part of the coliving model is focused on play. While coliving spaces are commonly built for professionals, the foundation of coliving is based on relationships cultivated through experience. Like traveling to a new country, or learning a new skill, bonding with a new person can be just as inspiring. Rather than just saying hello on your way to the office, coliving gives you the chance to meet your new coworkers through sharing experiences. Or rather, going on an adventure and playing together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many coliving spaces organize day trips and excursions.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sun-desk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sun Desk</a>&nbsp;is a great example of a coliving space trying to located the ideal work/life balance. The Moroccan-based spaces take advantage of the natural surroundings and local community. They offer surfing in partnership with the local surf school, or day trips to the local markets and surrounding areas, which are great ways to get to know your neighbour, inside and out. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><em>(This article was published on <a href=\"http://www.coliving.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.coliving.com</a>, they post amazing content about the coliving industry that we would love to share with you guys)</em></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Source_coliving.jpg', 1, '2017-11-08 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

For all members who stayed in.</p>', '<p><strong>Happy Thanksgiving! I know, we\'re a little late to the party, but we just wanted to share this article about our thanksgiving party here at Outpost a few weeks ago. For all members who stayed in New York City for Thanksgiving, Outpost Club really tried to create a sense of family and tradition. This is what happened!&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>While many of our members went home to be with their families this Thanksgiving, not everyone was able to do so. And a lot of our international members were interested in experiencing what this America holiday was like. Having heard about this, we knew it would be a great opportunity to have an event on a day that everyone has off!</p>\r\n<p>Our lovely house leaders that stayed in New York for holiday ran the show. In the morning, everyone woke up super early to meet up at the Thanksgiving Day Parade. Most of our members had never been to the parade, so it\'s clear to see their excitement in the pictures below.</p>\r\n<p>Then, later in the afternoon, the members went back to the Ridgewood and Knickerbocker House, and had Thanksgiving dinners! Outpost Club provided many of the mainstays (turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and pumpkin pie) while members were encouraged to bring their own dishes as well. In the end, our members\' bellies were full and a true American Thanksgiving was a success!</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><img title=\"Thanksgiving At Outpost Club (Image-1), outpost-club.com\"

One of the best in my point of view is Coursera <strong>UC Davis course on SEO and Social Media&nbsp;</strong>which in 4 weeks can teach you both basics and advanced techniques of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) with useful excel files you can use as well as promoting a business in social media from content to building of the useful connections with Opinion Leaders.

An interesting article by <strong>MIT Technology Review&nbsp;</strong>shows that paid advertisement at Facebook sometimes could be pretty questionable. There are as well a number of services mentioned in the article like MammothSocials.com or Boostlikes.com. As article <strong>Secret Strategies Revealed: Reaching 500k Facebook Likes&nbsp;</strong>suggests ways of exchanging Likes, buying Legitimate likes and working with Influencers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3) Influencers are the new preachers in the world of Marketing. Interesting discovery were special services like <strong>Klout, Tapinfluence, Peerindex</strong>.

It&rsquo;s a high-intensity city, where people are dead-set on being successful, and work harder than you could ever imagine. New Yorkers can frequently be rude, and the individualistic nature of the United States is ever-present here.</p>\r\n<p>If you are trying to make this place home, it might feel overwhelming; everyone always seems like they have something to do, somewhere to be, and well-adjusted to the insanity of this metropolis. This will all make you feel like the world is spinning too fast, and all you&rsquo;re trying to do is spin with it.</p>\r\n<p>The reality is this: a lot of people are doing the same thing you are (moving to New York City) and feeling the same way. So the good news is you&rsquo;re not alone, &ldquo;Every year, over 200,000 people come to New York City seeking to establish permanent residence here. One recent Pew survey found that nearly 50% of Americans under the age of 35 said they would like to live in New York City&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>All of these people are facing the same questions, &ldquo;How am I going to make friends?&rdquo; &ldquo;How am I going to find out about the opportunities this city has to offer?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is the nearest bar and best pizza?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who could I even ask about this?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Trying to find the answer to these questions is completely legitimate, yet the process of getting the answers faces some systemic problems. Though we live in an increasingly urbanized and technologically connected world, we seem to be drifting further and further apart as human beings. Making friends is tough in a big new city, and you need those friends to find out about the interesting things that are happening around you. You want to ask people you trust about the best bars and pizza, because budgets are finite and so is your time. And when everyone seems like they have it all figured out, its tough to admit you&rsquo;re &ldquo;new in town&rdquo; and that a helping hand would help immensely.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m here to tell you that there is someone to help out. Companies like ours, <a href=\"../\" target=\"_blank\">Outpost Club</a> have had many members come to us facing the same situation. The difference for them is that when they arrive, they are introduced to other people who have just arrived, and the <a href=\"../about/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outpost Club team</a>, who know about the area they live in, the best way for you to commute to work, and the best bars and pizza. We set up events so that you get to experience the city with others who are interested in seeing it too, and excited to make new friends in the process.</p>\r\n<p>When you experience coliving with Outpost Club, you&rsquo;ll show up with a suitcase, and leave with friends and experiences you might not have had in New York City otherwise.</p>\r\n<div><a href=\"../join-us\">Join Us</a></div>\r\n<p><img title=\"Moving to New York City is Tough, but There is a Solution (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Moving_to_NewYork/img-26.jpg\" alt=\"Moving to New York City is Tough, but There is a Solution (Image-1)\" /></p>', 'img-26.jpg', 1, '2017-05-15 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

First, <em>you have plenty of options</em>, forcing the competitors to give you a great price. <em>You know what you&rsquo;re supposed to pay for a coffee</em>, and how much the &ldquo;upgrades&rdquo; (lattes, mochas, etc.) should cost as well. If anyone charges more than this, <em>they won&rsquo;t get your business.</em> The quality of the coffee and the service you get <em>must also be great, </em>because if its not, you won&rsquo;t come back, and you&rsquo;ll tell your friends not to go either. If you are in a different country, you know that <em>big brand names</em> like Starbucks will give you the same quality that you received at home.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Most Expensive Yearly Cost, Worst Consumer Experience (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Most_Expensive/img-11.jpg\" alt=\"Most Expensive Yearly Cost, Worst Consumer Experience (Image-1)\" /></p>\r\n<p>A coffee is a small expense in average person\'s yearly budget, yet we receive a great consumer experience when we search for, order, buy, and taste our coffee. That&rsquo;s what makes it so frustrating that our largest yearly expense &ndash; rent/utilities &ndash; provides us with the worst consumer experience, maybe of all time.</p>\r\n<p>Searching for coffee is simple: maybe you use yelp, maybe you just walk around, no matter how you look, it&rsquo;s not hard to find. Searching for an apartment on the other hand is like having a second job. You must be constantly searching for the best options, going on walk-throughs, speaking with landlords and roommates, and ultimately settling for something that you might not even like, because you need a place to sleep soon! Granted, the decision-making process for coffee and housing is drastically different, but you would think that because the cost of housing is so high, the search would be easier. There&rsquo;s no centralized search for housing like yelp works for coffee.</p>\r\n<p>This <em>intentionally tough</em> search process makes it incredibly tough for the consumer to assess how much they should be paying for housing. Real estate agents are hired to show you the best parts of the property, and avoid the negative parts that you only discover while actually living at a property. There&rsquo;s also no big brand name that you can rely on for an assurance of quality.</p>\r\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the process of being approved for a lease by a landlord. It&rsquo;s up to their discretion; they accept and/or deny anyone they want, and their decision to deny you can be lawfully arbitrary. Background checks and credit checks might not accurately reflect your ability to be a good tenant, and for international tenants, these things might not even exist for you, meaning you might not be able to provide the documents necessary for renting an apartment.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, once you&rsquo;ve chosen a location to live at, and have committed to a lease, you find out that the service is most likely terrible. You don&rsquo;t know who to call when there&rsquo;s a broken power outlet, or when there&rsquo;s water damage creating mold. The worst part is that your landlord might not care at all; you&rsquo;re locked into a lease, and if you want to move out at the end of the lease, they&rsquo;ll just find someone to replace you. They&rsquo;re pros at the renting process, and since you only go through this consumer experience very infrequently, you&rsquo;re most likely&hellip; not.</p>\r\n<p>In the end, a couple simple facts are present: to get want you want, you need to be an extremely savvy renter in a market that you need to interact with very infrequently. Unlike coffee, you need housing, and the sellers know that, but we&rsquo;re here to tell you that it doesn&rsquo;t need to be this way.</p>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"../\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outpost Club</a>, we make housing easier by addressing each of the pain-points of acquiring housing. We provide you with <a href=\"../new-york\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">our options</a>, give you transparent, all-inclusive pricing, we provide month to month leases, and provide an <a href=\"../join-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">easy application process</a> unlike your average renter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you need extra encouragement,<a href=\"../blog_category/membermonday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> see what our members think.</a> They tell us that becoming a member and living at outpost club is as easy as buying a coffee.</p>', 'img-11.jpg', 1, '2017-05-17 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Let Jacob tell you why he joined Outpost Club and his position on coliving:</p>', '<p><img title=\"Welcome Jacob to the Team!

(Image-1)\" /></p>\r\n<h2>Jacob Shapiro, born-and-raised New Yorker, joins the Outpost Club. Let Jacob tell you why he joined Outpost Club and his position on coliving:</h2>\r\n<p><em>I felt alone, even in my own home, surrounded by my three best friends and roommates.</em></p>\r\n<p>It was this paradox that led me to think critically about my living arrangement. How could it be that my best friends and I created an atmosphere that made me feel alone? I never blamed them for it, nor did I ever tell them. I blamed myself, very common of my nature.</p>\r\n<p>I hadn&rsquo;t realized what I now know: it wasn&rsquo;t my fault or my friends; it was the living arrangement itself. The same living arrangement that millions of urban millennials live in across the US and the world: living with your friends <em>and only your friends</em>. Some urban millennials may live with complete strangers, but it is likely that they have no clue who their neighbors are. The immediate community around them are (and will remain) strangers from move-in to move-out.</p>\r\n<p>I tried to think back to a time when I really loved my housing accommodations, and I could only think of one instance: the two years I spent living in dorms at Champlain College, my alma mater. <em>Regardless of all its faults</em> it was my favorite living accommodations for two reasons:</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Welcome Jacob to the Team! (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Welcome_Jacob/img-1.png\" alt=\"Welcome Jacob to the Team! (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<p>The dorms at Champlain College are unlike most dorms. When you think of college dorms, one normally imagines big brick buildings with no character. Take a look at my freshman and sophomore dorms. Granted, I went to a rich-kid liberal arts school in the northeast, but the point still stands. When I came &ldquo;home&rdquo; it was not to a square brick building. It was a Victorian mansion converted into a dorm, where no room was like any other room. This living accommodation was pretty inspiring.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Welcome Jacob to the Team! (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Welcome_Jacob/img.png\" alt=\"Welcome Jacob to the Team! (Image-3)\" /></p>\r\n<p>The second reason I liked dorm living was the true sense of community that was instilled, even though it might have been a bit forced. In my sophomore dorm, I was the Resident Assistant (RA), the guy everybody usually hates. But instead of being the &ldquo;guy who gets everyone in trouble&rdquo; I was a friend, spending my free time in the common room just like any other student living there. I loved the fact that I didn&rsquo;t come home to an empty house, and that when I arrived, there was always someone sitting in the common room to ask me how my day was going.</p>\r\n<p>As I mentioned, dorm living had its faults (no kitchens, shared bedrooms, waiting to use bathrooms, etc.) but all of its faults are entirely amendable, while still preserving the benefits of its community atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>Dorm style living also came with unintended benefits that go completely overlooked. In apartment living, there&rsquo;s no easy way to break outside your friend group. Usually you and your friends hangout at your place, their place, or the bars, with no real interaction with others outside that friend group. By forced interaction, you break outside your friend group simply by being there; creating new friends and relationships you would have never had before. Best friends, romantic relationships, and even business partners have all met on shared living spaces provided by colleges. These relationships wouldn&rsquo;t have been fostered without forced interaction. All of this occurs while still maintaining privacy.</p>\r\n<p>Then there are the obvious benefits of dorm living, like the all-inclusive payment for rent, utilities, and a bed/desk. This collective payment is usually less expensive than an apartment due to the sharing of resources. Once I moved into an apartment off-campus, I realized that I took this aspect of dorm life for granted. When living in an apartment, you must split various utility bills and figure out who will buy household items like a TV or a microwave. To live in a dorm, all you have to do is show up with a suitcase.</p>\r\n<p>Yet for all its benefits, this living style is usually only accepted by college students (and sometimes individuals who decide to live in a retirement community). Sharing living space is usually viewed as collegiate, and is irregular otherwise. If there was a point to this piece it would be this: as tenants, homeowners, and landlords, we need to stop looking at shared living spaces as a childish living accommodation, or an arrangement that can only exist during the formative college years and is irreplicable after that.</p>\r\n<p>Post-college millennials have already been doing this for a long time. Living with one&rsquo;s friends while working is obviously not a new concept. But for those like me who find that this model is not enough, thankfully there is already an industry that provides this service: coliving.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'img-17.jpg', 1, '2017-05-03 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

I brought a giant roll of paper and drawing markers (not to mention, beer), and we did full body drawings of members as they walked in the door.&nbsp; The full body drawings were done by laying the paper on the floor, and we asked participants to lay down on the paper.&nbsp;We drew the outlines of their bodies, like a line-drawing portrait of each member.</p>\r\n<p>\"Then we hung the life-sized full-body portraits around the house and members continued to draw on them throughout the week.

Outpost Club has expanded to five houses and continues to grow in members, staff, alumni, and locations month-over-month. But in my short time here, I\'ve noticed something when speaking with people who know nothing about coliving: they have a lot of preconceived notions, and they are usually always negative. I want to use this article clear up some misconceptions of what coliving is, specifically for Outpost Club (I can\'t speak on behalf of other coliving operators).</p>\r\n<h2>Here are some things I hear people say:</h2>\r\n<p><strong>\"Oh, It\'s a dorm!\"</strong><br />No, it\'s not a dorm. Dorms usually don\'t have kitchens, and sometimes don\'t have common rooms. In most dorms, you don\'t get to pick your room accommodation, you\'re almost always sharing a room, and only sometimes do you get to choose your location. At Outpost Club, you can pick whatever style room you want (shared or private), and move around after you\'ve arrived.</p>\r\n<p><strong>\"If it\'s not a dorm, it\'s still only for college students\"</strong><br />Incorrect. Yes, we have members who are students, but we also have members who are professionals in their field, entrepreneurs, travelers, freelancers, and from all other walks of life.</p>\r\n<p><strong>\"Oh, well then it must be a hostel!\"</strong><br />Still, not the case. Hostels are places for short stays. You might make some friends at a hostel, but it is lacking community.&nbsp;At Outpost Club the minimum stay is a month, allowing members to get to know each other and become a part of our community. We provide common areas you\'d actually want to hang out in, hold events, and have a house leader at each location to facilitate this community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You guys share things, so it\'s gotta be a commune!</strong><br />Yeah... that\'s a large oversimplification. Sure, we share essentials <a href=\"../\" target=\"_blank\">(see what included in membership)</a>&nbsp;but other than that we share only space. We cook our own meals <a href=\"../blog/potluck-dinner-at-outpost-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(other than at potlucks)</a>&nbsp;work independently, and take our own showers (you\'d be surprised what some people assume about our members).</p>\r\n<p><strong>\"There\'s no way it stays clean\"</strong><br />Each house has a cleaner that comes once a week. The cleaner \"resets\" the house by cleaning all common rooms, changing the sheets on your bed, and restocking all the essential items we provide. The cleanliness of your room, like always, is up to you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>\"It must be loud all the time.\"</strong><br />Quiet hours start at 10pm, and they are observed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>\"If I lived there, I\'d never get any privacy.\"</strong><br />You can alway find a place to be alone in any of our houses. If you work from home, the only other people who will be at home will most likely also be working. If you share a room, roommates take vacations, and sometimes sleepover at friends houses. You can also communicate with roommates about privacy, it\'s up to you to make those accommodations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>\"I\'ve never done coliving before so I don\'t know what it would be like\"</strong><br />The thing is, you\'ve probably done coliving before and just don\'t know it. Outpost Club\'s definition of coliving is \"A shared housing model with mid-to-long-term stays\" that\'s it.&nbsp;Have you ever shared a house with someone? If so, you\'re already halfway there.</p>\r\n<p>As I mentioned at the beginning, most of the preconceived notions that people have about coliving are negative. But there is a bright side to this: almost all of these negative assumptions evaporate the moment someone holding these assumptions walk into a coliving space. My advice to anyone interested in coliving is this:&nbsp;<em>go see a coliving space in person.</em>&nbsp;There have been so many times where I show someone an Outpost Club space,&nbsp;and they say something like \"Oh, it\'s just an apartment with people in it.\" I\'m not sure what these people were imagining beforehand, but showing them the physical space removes all doubts they had about living in these spaces.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of leaving you with all the things coliving is not, here is what coliving with Outpost Club looks like:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>\r\n<p>Outpost Club is a network of coliving locations throughout New York. Our goal is to make it super easy to move to New York, and to provide <strong>interesting and convenient places for affordable prices.</strong>&nbsp;But at Outpost Club, you receive more than just a place to live and work. The Outpost Club platform creates a coliving community that offers both general and professional networking, which personally benefits all members.</p>\r\n<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>\r\n<p>Outpost Club provides end-to-end co-living services to tech startups, entrepreneurs, digital nomads, freelancers, remote workers, professionals, students, and anyone looking to move to a new city and meet new people.&nbsp;<strong>Coliving is a shared housing model.</strong>&nbsp;Members share kitchens, living rooms, and other common spaces with all members, and have a private or shared bedrooms of your choice.&nbsp;<strong>Everything is included in our flat fee:</strong>&nbsp;utilities, wifi, furniture, appliances, kitchen supplies, and anything else you would need upon moving into a new place. All you need to bring is your suitcase. Fill in the application, have a brief interview, grab your suitcase and move in! You&rsquo;ll meet new people who will become your friends for life.</p>\r\n<h3>WHY WE DO IT</h3>\r\n<p>Even though New York houses millions of people, many of us feel lonely due to their housing arrangement and the individualistic nature of urban American culture. Despite this, at Outpost Club&rsquo;s co-living locations, you&rsquo;ll never come home to an empty house, and you will never feel alone.</p>', 'breaking-the-preconceived-notions-of-coliving.jpg', 1, '2017-08-29 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

To answer this question we.</p>', '<p><strong>There are probably hundreds of housing options for any one person in a </strong>city,<strong> and thousands of vacant apartments waiting to be filled by you, so why live at Outpost Club. To answer this question we must first answer another: why chose </strong>coliving<strong>?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Modern coliving has emerged from many factors that influence how people live. The first reason is the obvious financial benefit of coliving: the more you share, the more you save. Our members share kitchens, living rooms, bathrooms,&nbsp;coworking spaces, and sometimes even bedrooms. But the benefits of coliving are not only financial. Moving to a new city might seem like moving to a whole new group of friends, but that\'s not always the case. Ironically, in dense urban areas, rates of loneliness are usually higher than tight-knit, smaller communities. Coliving can be used as a way to avoid this loneliness and to make friends.</p>\r\n<p>Coliving also makes the process of moving to a new city easier. This is actually the reason the founders of Outpost Club decided to start providing coliving spaces. As international tenants in the US, finding housing was tough. Credit checks, background checks, language barriers, buying furniture, setting up utilities, and all other move-in difficulties. They saw a void in the housing market that desperately needed a solution.</p>\r\n<h2>So why Outpost Club?</h2>\r\n<p>Because we know what it\'s like to move to a new city, we\'ve done it ourselves. Our mission is to make housing easy, and we achieve this by removing the pain points of moving, both logistically and socially.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"../memberships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">See what we provide</a>, and come live with us.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'why-choose-outpost-club.jpeg', 1, '2017-08-29 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

It&rsquo;s a city where you need a home,.</p>', '<h3>My experience with Coliving in New York City, and why you should do it too</h3>\r\n<p>For the last 4 months, I have been working towards moving from Belgium to New York City. It&rsquo;s a city where you need a home, otherwise you&rsquo;ll go nuts pretty fast. When looking for a place to stay, I never really thought about coliving as an option. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even know what it was before I arrived here in April this year. Four days before I left Europe, I was looking for a place to stay on Air-BnB and I found one in Brooklyn that was affordable. It mentioned that I would have a shared room, but I didn&rsquo;t really think much about it at the time.</p>\r\n<p>When I travel I always stay in Hostels. They&rsquo;re affordable hotels in good locations where you share a room with anywhere from 2&ndash;50 people (pro tip, don&rsquo;t go higher than 9 people, from there on it gets kind of crazy &nbsp;Simply put, I&rsquo;m used to sharing rooms. But what&rsquo;s different about coliving is that the people you&rsquo;re staying with will be there for an extended period of time. You build up friendships, get lunch together, share the same TV remote&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>With that said, I&rsquo;d like to break down the pros and cons of coliving.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What I like about coliving so far:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Coming from a different country, It&rsquo;s nice to get to know people right away. It&rsquo;s a real friendship starter; what better a a way to become friends with people than live with them?</li>\r\n<li>It&rsquo;s a sort of relationship that&rsquo;s not really comparable to anything else. They&rsquo;re not your family (even though we say we are), they&rsquo;re not your high school friends, and they didn&rsquo;t grow up in the same city you did. We are totally random strangers who all come together with totally different backgrounds and aspirations.</li>\r\n<li>It&rsquo;s cheap AF. Compared to a normal lease it&rsquo;s relatively cheap. Also considering the fact that you don&rsquo;t need to buy any furniture, utensils, plates, bowls, appliances, utilities, etc.</li>\r\n<li>It&rsquo;s flexible. Your contract only lasts for a month, so you can leave or move-in whenever you want. Even within your city, you can move from place to place if you wanted to. In addition, you can move-in or out on any day of the month.</li>\r\n<li>You pay for a place to stay, not your personal square footage. What I mean by this is that in this economy, millennials do not feel very attracted to ownership. Alternatives to buying a place like renting and now coliving are way more attractive to us.</li>\r\n<li>You simply have more space than in a normal New York apartment. In NYC, rent prices are insane; we&rsquo;re talking 2500$ for a 2 bedroom apartment. Any less than that, you&rsquo;re basically living in a shoebox. With coliving, because you share space, the rooms are bigger.</li>\r\n<li>The company takes care of everything. If a window breaks, the toilet doesn&rsquo;t flush, or the fridge is broken, you don&rsquo;t need to check your savings account. It&rsquo;s all been taken care of.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>What I don&rsquo;t like:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Sometimes it&rsquo;s too busy. There are 15 people staying in my coliving space divided over 2 floors, and sometimes that&rsquo;s too much. You don&rsquo;t always feel the need to be around other people. I solve this by taking the subway somewhere, put my headphones in and close my eyes. But it&rsquo;s just something to be aware of.</li>\r\n<li>If you don&rsquo;t like your roommate you\'re f*cked. Sometimes it just happens and you&rsquo;ll just have to wait it out or ask for a room change. It&rsquo;s important to have open communication with your roommate about concepts of cleanliness, quiet time, etc.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In despite some minor concerns, I love the trend of sharing. It&rsquo;s the only way younger people can afford living in cities, and it&rsquo;s actually quiet fun! I hope you enjoyed this article and I hope you found it useful!</p>\r\n<p>Also, if you want to know more about the coliving space I&rsquo;m currently staying with, check out this website!&nbsp;<a href=\"../\" target=\"_blank\">outpost-club.com</a></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>If you liked it please give this article a big Applause! what do you think about Coliving, would you try it?

So here is our list of reasons to live/work in coliving:</h3>\r\n<p><strong><em>It\'s a rapidly growing industry.</em></strong><br />There seem to be new companies opening coliving spaces everyday. Nevertheless, the industry is still small, and developing skills that only a small group of people currently have gives you a great advantage when looking for jobs.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>You\'re surrounded by motivated people.</em></strong><br />When living and working with people who took a chance on entering this new industry, you\'ll be surrounded by people who get it. By \"get it\" we mean that they understand this:&nbsp;the way in which we\'ve historically thought about our housing accommodations and our working hours is changing. These are people at the forefront of a rapid shift in the way we live our daily lives.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>You can commute to your kitchen, or anywhere for that matter.</strong> </em><br />All of our employees (and members who are freelancing/working from home) use our spaces to work from home, productively. Some sit in the kitchen, some sit in the coworking space, but regardless, home becomes a place of work during the day.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>You\'re working for a community, not an apartment building.</em></strong><br />Work has more meaning when you are truly a part of something, that\'s why most of our employees both work and live in our spaces. When the work you do directly impacts your surroundings, it is obvious that your work holds importance.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>If it\'s a startup, you can have a large impact, quickly.</em></strong><br />When you work at a startup, it\'s all-hands-on-deck. If you can show that you are an integral part of the team, you will gain new responsibilities, quickly. You might be tasked with revamping the entire communications strategy and executing it, or hiring and managing the newest employees, or creating the agenda and running meetings with your supervisors. All of which are valuable skills for any job, and you can gain them quickly at a startup.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>And our favorite benefit: </strong>You\'ll meet people from all over the world</em><br />If you live and work in our spaces for as little as six months, you are likely to live with as many as 15 nationalities at any given time, and over 50 nationalities over the duration of that stay. Some of our employees like to say \"I have a home to stay at in over 30 countries, all from the friends I\'ve made here.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'eastbushwick_small-co-space.jpg', 1, '2017-09-05 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

With it being the headquarters of every major company, it comes to no surprise that almost everyone.</p>', '<p><strong>NYC is one of the largest cities in the world, with an estimated 8.6 million population size. With it being the headquarters of every major company, it comes to no surprise that almost everyone with a global-sized dream has, or plans to move to the Big Apple at some point in their life.</strong></p>\r\n<p>But moving here is not as easy as packing your bags and checking into the first hotel you come across. First of all, hotels are ridiculously expensive, and so are other types of accommodation. Even if you are lucky enough to find one that is affordable, chances are you will end up in a shoe-box sized apartment.</p>\r\n<p>It is also easy to feel lonely and lost in a city this size, where everyone is too busy chasing after their own American dream to just stop and say hello to a stranger they meet on the bustling streets of NYC.</p>\r\n<p>This brings us to the number one reason why you should opt for co-living.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>1. COMMUNITY</h3>\r\n<p>Co-living, as you will discover when you come and live with us in Outpost Club, provides you with the most important element when moving to a new city: community. The second you check into our co-living space, you will get to meet people from all sorts of backgrounds. Some of them may even have a story similar to yours.</p>\r\n<p>To make the assimilation process even easier, we at Outpost Club regularly organize events that get residents from all of our six houses together. Our members are also encouraged to host their own get-togethers, like potluck dinners and game nights. Recently one house even threw an &ldquo;Ugly Sweater Party&rdquo;. Can you imagine a better way to break the ice with your new Housemates?</p>\r\n<p>Basically, with co-living you&rsquo;ll end up with friends who you can spend your nights in with. And you\'ll always have someone to do something with on the weekends.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"7 Reasons Why You Should Co-Live With Outpost Club (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/7_REASONS/rene-bohmer-490009-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"7 Reasons Why You Should Co-Live With Outpost Club (Image-1)\" /></p>\r\n<h3>2. JUST BRING YOUR SUITCASE</h3>\r\n<p>Remember when we said that moving to New York can be challenging? Well, we aim to make this process as convenient as possible for you. As a start, you can move in with us whenever you want to! And all you need is just your suitcase. We take care of the rest. Towels? Comfortable beds and sheets? Shampoos and body gel? Pots and pans? We got them all sorted for you.</p>\r\n<p>You also won&rsquo;t have to worry about the nitty-gritty of maintaining an apartment. If any of the appliances are not working, you just have to let us know and we&rsquo;ll take care of it. To top it off, we have professional cleaners coming over twice a week to clean the spaces.. including your room!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>3. FREE COFFEE!</h3>\r\n<p>This one deserves the exclamation mark and a stand-alone mention, as we all know there isn\'ta problem that can\'t be solved with a cup of coffee. To help you kick-start your day - or night if you\'re the \"burn the midnight oil\" type of person - we supply good quality coffee powder so you can have your dose of caffeine anytime you need it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"7 Reasons Why You Should Co-Live With Outpost Club (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/7_REASONS/Copy%2Bof%2BIMG_4114.jpg\" alt=\"7 Reasons Why You Should Co-Live With Outpost Club (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<h3>4. SHARED SPACE = MORE SPACE</h3>\r\n<p>Almost everything in NYC is expensive. While it might be alright to skim on certain luxuries like entertainment and shopping, you shouldn\'t have to compromise on your resting space when you just want to sit back and relax.</p>\r\n<p>From a fully furnished bedroom with not just a bed, but also shelves, cabinet spaces and reading lights, to a common living room complete with a 55-inch TV, big couches, and a co-working space (just to name a few); we provide them all for your comfort. Also, as you are paying for membership instead of just rent, you can move around our six different houses if you wish to.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"7 Reasons Why You Should Co-Live With Outpost Club (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4068949/Imported_Blog_Media/Screen+Shot+2018-02-20+at+15_29_59_png_59.png\" alt=\"7 Reasons Why You Should Co-Live With Outpost Club (Image-3)\" /></p>\r\n<h3>5. SAFETY</h3>\r\n<p>At Outpost Club you never have to worry about your safety, or even of your belongings. Our common spaces have CCTV cameras, our houses all have code-access front doors, on site house leaders, and august home security locks!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>6. NO KEYS, NO WORRIES</h3>\r\n<p>We have replaced the traditional key system with automated locks that are either password or phone-operated. This means you don\'t have to worry about taking your keys (or forgetting them) with you everytime you leave the house.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>7.

Fake it till you make it I always say.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>I, along with 16 other interns, </em><em>were</em><em> split by </em><em>department</em><em> and given accounts to work on over the course of the internship. Interns ranged from juniors in college to a 30-year-old who wanted to become an advertiser.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Throughout the internship, mentorship sessions/workshops were set up by HR where industry vets and agency employees would share valuable information about the advertising world.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>I was able to work on high exposure brands which I was then able to see in real-world settings (i.e. TV spots).</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What was the most exciting bit about your internship?</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;Look out for FREE events on Facebook!&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>I got to meet Jim O&rsquo;Heir, who plays Jerry Gergich on Parks and Recreation.

I spent </em><em>waaaaay</em><em> too much on alcohol. Pregame &gt; buying drinks at the bar.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>(Also), living with a roommate can be tough, but living in a whole HOUSE of roommates can be even tougher.

If you use your time in NYC and at Outpost with positivity, then you&rsquo;ll be able to make friendships that&rsquo;ll last a lifetime!</em></p>\r\n<p><em>In terms of packing, think minimalist. Be open to the city. Make eye contact with everyone. Talk to people you wouldn&rsquo;t normally talk to. Try new cuisines. New York is the portal to the world. There are so many languages spoken in the city and so many different cuisines to enrich your pallet.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Stay aware of your surroundings and always make sure you have your wallet, phone, and keys on you.

Last year it was ranked second on Property Shark&rsquo;s top 2017 &ldquo;<strong>Real Estate Pros Choose NYC&rsquo;s Hottest Neighborhoods&rdquo;</strong><a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/Real-Estate-Reports/2017/01/17/NYC-real-estate-market-predictions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">.</a>&nbsp;It came on top of even neighborhoods such as the Lower and the Upper East Side that are traditionally known to be the more popular places to live.</p>\r\n<p>This is attributed largely to the rapid development of the area that has driven up its property market price - while still being in the affordable range - to invite in more of the middle-class group.</p>\r\n<p>The artsy vibe contributed by the various hip cafes and street arts that sprung up over the last few years have also pulled in the youth as well as the hipster community into the area.</p>\r\n<p>In short, along with a safer neighborhood, Bushwick also offers an attractive lifestyle that caters to all types of people. Hence why <a href=\"../\" target=\"_blank\">Outpost Club</a>&nbsp;has three of its houses&nbsp;located in this area.</p>\r\n<p>Read on for more reasons why Bushwick is the place to live, compiled from the input provided by Outpost\'s members&nbsp;themselves.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"The Appeal of Living in Bushwick (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-08%20at%203.21.58%20PM.png\" alt=\"The Appeal of Living in Bushwick (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h3>1. Diversity</h3>\r\n<div><br /><em><strong>\"Bushwick is one of the more diverse neighborhoods in Brooklyn. I have lived in four major US cities, and only Brooklyn offers the opportunity to meet people from all sorts of backgrounds.\",&nbsp;</strong></em>Simon Bogdanov, Outpost\'s Bushwick House member since October 2017.</div>\r\n<p>Bushwick has a truly diverse population that is visible even when you\'re simply walking down the street to a corner store five minutes away from your apartment. It is also reflected in the composition of our Bushwick&nbsp;and East Bushwick&rsquo;s Houses.</p>\r\n<p>The diversity makes for an interesting night out, where you can expect to meet and befriend different people with their own unique styles as well as cultural backgrounds.</p>\r\n<div><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"The Appeal of Living in Bushwick (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/The_Appeal_of_Living/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_502b-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Appeal of Living in Bushwick (Image-2)\" /></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Oscar Cerrato</div>\r\n<h3>2. Street Arts</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>\"Bushwick is unique for its urban style. It\'s very wild, in the sense that it\'s also edgy.\",&nbsp;</strong></em>Oscar Cerrato, Outpost\'s Bushwick House member since August 2017.</p>\r\n<p>Bushwick has a huge and impressive street art scene that gives the area a cool artistic feel.</p>\r\n<p>It is made even more exciting with organized murals coordinated by Bushwick-native Joe Ficalora, through his project coined as <strong>\"The Bushwick Collective\".</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are also plenty of gallery spaces you can visit to check out the neighborhood\'s booming art scene.</p>\r\n<p>And if you\'re a fan of street arts and photography, just take your camera out on a bright sunny day and you\'re all set for some Instagram-worthy photos!</p>\r\n<h3>3. Affordability</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>\"NYC is expensive. There is only a handful of neighborhoods that are affordable, and Bushwick is one of them.\",</strong> </em>Simon Bogdanov, self-proclaimed \"broke\" UX designer.</p>\r\n<p>Bushwick has unparalleled options when it comes to affordable items.</p>\r\n<p>Just 10 minutes&rsquo; walk from Outpost\'s Bushwick House is the L Train Vintage&nbsp;shop that boasts of being \"the most affordable vintage clothing\" in New York City.</p>\r\n<p>And then there is the \"Deli and Grill\" store just at the corner of Jefferson Street, where our house is located. It has pretty much everything you need - from the standard cooking items, to complete meals like our members\' favorite: chicken over rice (it costs only $5!).</p>\r\n<p>If you\'re more of a pizza kind of person, several spots like <strong><a href=\"https://www.jimmyspizzeriamenu.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy\'s Pizza</a>&nbsp;</strong>offer a personal-sized pie at just $5.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Safety</h3>\r\n<div><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"The Appeal of Living in Bushwick (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/The_Appeal_of_Living/img-35.jpg\" alt=\"The Appeal of Living in Bushwick (Image-3)\" />Jacob Shapiro</div>\r\n<p><em><strong>\"There is this international reputation of Brooklyn being dangerous.

My female friends say the same.\",&nbsp;</strong></em>Jacob Shapiro, Outpost\'s <a href=\"../nyc-rooms-for-rent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York</a> account manager.</p>\r\n<p>Bushwick was once known as an unsafe area. But this has changed over the last few years, with the rate of crimes reported decreasing significantly.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, Bushwick was noted to be much safer&nbsp;compared to other popular neighborhoods such as Williamsburg, Greenwich Village, and Midtown Manhattan.</p>\r\n<h3>5. Location</h3>\r\n<div><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"The Appeal of Living in Bushwick (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/The_Appeal_of_Living/11010983_10203359178132955_3443272589415548904_n.jpg\" alt=\"The Appeal of Living in Bushwick (Image-4)\" /></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Ana Xavier</div>\r\n<p><em><strong>\"Bushwick\'s location is really good as it has four subway lines. And there are also a lot of places you can go to chill.\",&nbsp;</strong></em>Ana Xavier, Outpost\'s Bushwick House member since February 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Bushwick has four subway lines: the L, J, M, and Z. On top of that, there are also three bus lines that will take you to major parts of the city.</p>\r\n<p>This means transportation will never be on the list of things you&rsquo;d have to worry about when living here. You&rsquo;ll never run out of options to pick from, to ensure you get to your destination within reasonable time.</p>\r\n<p>The neighborhood also has a variety of bars, eateries, and coffee shops for you to explore. A favorite among our members is <strong>Father Knows Best,</strong> where you can get a pint of beer for as low as $5.</p>\r\n<p>If you\'re a vegetarian (and vegan),&nbsp;Routine&nbsp;is the perfect place for you. It is located just a short walk from the Wilson Avenue stop on the L train, and has an interior that would make for some great photos!</p>\r\n<p>Be sure to experience all these for yourself by making a visit to Bushwick an item on your weekend to-do-list. You can also check out our social media pages to get a glimpse of what the neighborhood has to offer!</p>\r\n<p>The allure of Bushwick is indescribable, and once you visit the neighborhood, you\'ll see why it\'s great.

I graduated from law school last summer and arrived in New York in early September for an internship at the UN. I\'ve been living here at Outpost ever since.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I&rsquo;m not studying or working, I love watching movies, going to concerts and playing soccer. I want to add &ldquo;reading books&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve carried the same two books to about 11 countries by now and it\'s just not happening.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<h3>What&rsquo;s your favorite Outpost memory?</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My favorite Outpost memory is also my first one: the hiking trip to Bear Mountain. The weather was great, the hike and views were amazing, we barbecued by the water and I got to meet a bunch of really cool people.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than that, Thanksgiving in our house was definitely a highlight. When you go to the liquor store and come back with a Christmas tree, you know it\'s gonna be a good day.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<h3>Do you have a favorite place in Brooklyn?</h3>\r\n<p>Is it lame to say DUMBO? Probably, but it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fairness, Brooklyn has so many great spots it&rsquo;s hard to choose. I really love downtown Brooklyn and Greenpoint; they have a very different but equally great vibe.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To actually answer the question: the William Vale hotel in Williamsburg. It&rsquo;s an awesomely designed building and hands down the best rooftop in Brooklyn (make that New York). Honorable mention: Sunset Park.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<h3>What are you currently working on? What are you doing next?</h3>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m currently wrapping up my internship at the UN&rsquo;s Department of Peacekeeping Operations. I specifically work on the disarmament of combatants and their reintegration into society after civil wars and armed conflicts. Pretty cool stuff.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I&rsquo;m doing next: two months of traveling through South America. After that, your guess is as good as mine, but it will probably be in a place I&rsquo;ve never been before.</span></p>', 'Outpost.jpg', 1, '2019-01-07 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

I think my roommate noticed it because he apologized for making me wait, and he went to cook upstairs instead! (I forgot that in the Ridgewood House there are three kitchens).

I thought he looks like someone I can get along with. I was right, because he\'s friendly and easy going. Although I also thought he was annoying at first,\" said Oscar, before bursting into laughter. \"He had.. a peculiar sense of humor. But I learn to understand him, and now he\'s one of my great friends!\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I just silently hoped he doesn\'t snore,\" said Simon. \"Just kidding. In all seriousness, I thought he was a really cool guy.\"</p>\r\n<p>But according to the duo, it was their common interests that solidified their friendship.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"We share common interests, like cars and drinks,\" said Simon.</p>\r\n<p>\"And we both like girls,\" Oscar interjected. \"Just have to make that clear.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"As we are both car enthusiasts, in November last year we went on a road trip to Cold Spring together. It was really fun to have someone to do that with. To be your partner-in-crime almost,\" Simon continued.</p>\r\n<p>\"We drove separate cars by the way. It\'s not like we were holding hands or whatever. Again, just need to make that clear,\" added Oscar.</p>\r\n<p>In just a short few months, Oscar and Simon have made memories that took others a lifetime to accomplish.</p>\r\n<p>One of them was when they pranked a fellow housemate by putting a sock on her room\'s doorknob.</p>\r\n<p>\"She is also a really good friend of ours.

It was funny.. And sad to watch, because he can\'t dance,\" said Oscar. \"Oh and also, he was wearing sweatpants.. like a grandpa.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\"I tried,\" added Simon.</p>\r\n<p>Their story definitely brought a smile to our faces.

I cannot describe the happiness I felt in that moment.</p>\r\n<p>And it\'s hard to name just one, because every day was a challenge: braving the freezing cold, meeting new people, learning about new cultures and a different language. I must say, traveling and staying in NYC has changed my life.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What do you think of coliving?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Finding a place to stay that combines good price and great location in NYC is a real challenge. You need to have a lot of money saved up, and be able to take up different living opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>I find that the best part of living in a coliving is the interaction with people. You can communicate with everybody. Also, the sense of community makes you remember that person-to-person communication nowadays is rare.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes it\'s a challenge to figure out everyone\'s personalities. But for me, that point was essential in the process of learning different cultures. This made me grow up as a person. You can be by yourself if you want, or hang out with the people in the house. Both are ok.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What\'s been your best experience in the time you have stayed at Outpost?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Outpost experience was memorable and unique as a whole. It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint just one. The location of Bushwick House, being on the coolest Brooklyn neighborhood was amazing for me!</p>\r\n<p>I also can say that the New Year&rsquo;s party organized at the house was essential in making me feel like part of NY and Outpost.

Four years ago he decided to pack his bags and make NYC his new home. Despite the challenges he faced here, Simon never gave up. Instead, he picked up all the tricks to survive NYC and make it a mission to help those who share the same big city dream he has.</p>\r\n<p>This has quickly made him our <a href=\"https://www.outpost-club.com/blog/\">members</a>\' go-to person for all things NYC.</p>\r\n<p>From networking techniques and creating the perfect resume, to finding out the best chicken and waffles spot in NYC, Simon can help you achieve your dreams while making sure you have the best time of your life.</p>\r\n<p>So read on for the five things you should know about him.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1) A People Person</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>I moved to New York 4 years ago, so I know what it\'s like moving to the city. I believe that co-living and Outpost Club is a great way to help people who had moved here, and I simply want to be a part of it.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>As a house leader, I make sure everyone who is staying here have a great time. If there\'s anything I can help out with, I try to do so.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The best part is I get to organize </em><a href=\"https://www.outpost-club.com/blog-outpost-club/2018/2/15/because-everyone-is-entitled-to-the-day-of-love-outpost-club\"><em>parties</em></a><em>, and get paid for it.&nbsp;</em><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>2) Loves Diversity</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>One thing I love about the US is how diverse it is, and the fact that I get to meet people from all over the world. Outpost Club is also a great environment for that. Everyone here is from different countries and speak different languages. So we always talk about our cultures, and learn a little bit of this and that.</em></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"5 Things About Bushwick House Leader: Simon Bogdanov (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/5_Things/img-20.jpg\" alt=\"5 Things About Bushwick House Leader: Simon Bogdanov (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>3) Fun Party Buddy</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>We always have something to do on the weekends here at Outpost. Every now and then we organize something fun at the house, like a housemate bonding time where we have a few drinks- one, two, three, 10, 20.&nbsp;Afterwards we would head to the city and do everything fun.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>4) Funny</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>A Mexican magician does a trick. He says to the audience: I will disappear on the count of three. He goes uno, dos, and disappears. He disappeared without a \'tres\'.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>5) Better Than Yelp</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>I was schooled outside the US, so I know geography well (just kidding!). Learning NYC has been pretty easy for me because I know how to read a map, and this led me to discover new, fun places.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>So I love taking our members see the city and discovering new food. Especially if they never had American food before!</em></p>\r\n<p>Well,&nbsp;that\'s five. But there are still so much more to know about Simon!

The coping strategy best suited to you will depend on your personality, but you can try segmenting your time so that you have a designated hour (or more) of each day where you allow yourself to think about or read the latest news articles and feel your feelings, then spending the rest of the day engaged in activities designed to distract yourself from the current global situation.</p>\r\n<p>Our minds have a habit of throwing up negative eventualities (e.g. &ldquo;What if this goes on forever?&rdquo;), so try countering these negative questions with positive ones (e.g. &ldquo;What if this reduces global warming?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What if this brings me closer to my friends and family?&rdquo;).&nbsp;Try&nbsp;reading &ldquo;good&rdquo; news headlines as well as negative reports and take the global situation one step at a time. Take every day as it comes and try to give yourself things to look forward to on a regular basis, remembering that this will pass.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Stay connected with others (virtually)</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the hardest parts of this pandemic is being physically distant from friends and family, but virtual platforms such as </span><a href=\"https://www.skype.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skype</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can go a long way to helping you not only keep in contact with them but in tricking your brain into thinking you&rsquo;re interacting with people. Human contact is important for mental health, but video calling can go some way toward undoing the negative effects of isolation. More and more entertainment venues are even putting on video conference parties, from Instagram Live concerts to &ldquo;</span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/houseofyes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital dance parties</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&rdquo; which can simulate being out and about with friends without actually leaving the house.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Ways to take care of your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_18.jpg\" alt=\"Ways to take care of your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (Image-2)\" width=\"436\" height=\"527\" />4.&nbsp;</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Take care of others</strong>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing good deeds for other people gives us a major mental health boost, making us feel great and offering a distraction from negative thoughts. If you&rsquo;re able to leave your house, why not offer to buy essential goods for vulnerable people in your neighborhood (leaving everything on their doorstep to ensure a no-contact delivery)? Otherwise, you can get online and donate to one of the many non-profit organizations helping those struggling during the pandemic. Or why not donate your time&mdash;you could volunteer to supplement the home schooling of a child whose parents or carers don&rsquo;t have the ability or resources to adequately do so themselves or offer your professional skills for free to someone whose small business can&rsquo;t afford a contractor right now.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Ways to take care of your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/IMG_0372.jpeg\" alt=\"Ways to take care of your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (Image-3)\" width=\"513\" height=\"385\" /></span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Keep exercising</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know that exercising is beneficial to our mental health, but just because you can&rsquo;t go to the gym doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to stop exercising. Take full advantage of the opportunity to exercise and get fresh air, even if you only speed walk around the block or run like crazy for a grand total of 3 minutes. Any amount or duration of exercise can have a positive effect on your mental health, just exposing yourself to some vitamin D will give your brain and body a much needed boost. If you can&rsquo;t go outside right now, you can turn your bedroom into a yoga studio or simply do jumping jacks in your room. You can find plenty of home exercise videos on </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umcrqneCpo4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Youtube</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as trying subscription services such as </span><a href=\"https://yogainternational.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoga International</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to boost your mood without leaving the house.</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', '1_21.jpg', 1, '2020-03-16 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

But it hasn\'t always been this way.</p>\r\n<p>Long before the mushrooming of hipster-approved art-themed pubs and cafe, certain corners of the borough were decorated only by the stereotypical Chinese take-out restaurants and fast food outlets.</p>\r\n<p>This did not sit well with Chris Taha when he visited Bushwick\'s Wilson Ave three years ago.</p>\r\n<p>\"What makes this neighborhood so beautiful is the array of artists, musicians, and creatives. (There are) so many different types of people with so many amazing qualities to offer,\" said Taha.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"(But) I felt their talent was being underutilized. So we wanted to create a space where they can share their ideas, their creativity, and collaborate in really cool ways,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>An idea for a community-based space struck him then. Together with business partner Colleen Makary, they founded Father Knows Best.</p>\r\n<p>\"My dad is an artist. That\'s partially why I came up with the name Father Knows Best. I grew up in this whole artist lifestyle,&nbsp;and I feel Bushwick is a cool representation of that. And I want to dedicate the place to my dad,\" said Taha.</p>\r\n<p>Father Knows Best, located just 9 minutes\' walk from our Bushwick House, and about 5 minutes from the East Bushwick House, has quickly become a favorite among Outpost\'s&nbsp;members.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div><img title=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Outpost_Recommends/20180228_130508_1519932198338.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-2)\" /> The inside of Father Knows Best</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It\'s easy to see why. The place doubles as a cafe during the day, and a bar that serves food all the way until midnight.</p>\r\n<p>\"We have amazing brunch that has been really cool and unexpected. On a Friday night you can typically expect music - definitely hip-hop, definitely a little bit louder,\" said Taha.</p>\r\n<p>\"But on Wednesdays, we\'ve got a nice trivia night. If you want to do a Tinder date on a Monday and listen to some mellow live jazz, you can do that too,\" he added. \"It\'s like an array of different events. We\'re not just a hip-hop, or jazz, or a trivia spot. There\'s a little bit of everything for everyone.\"</p>\r\n<p>Its simple and creative layout accompanied by a spacious outdoor area in the back, give the place a cool, chilled vibe that is perfect for those who are looking for a fun, yet relaxing night out.</p>\r\n<p>The space also offers a perfect working environment during the day, with plug points provided at almost every seating options available.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div><img title=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Outpost_Recommends/20180228_122731_1519933177839.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-3)\" /> Chris Taha, Co-Founder of Father Knows Best</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"Our plans for the future is to stay as involved in the community as possible, and to keep inspiring creativity and collaborations between our neighbors,\" said Taha.</p>\r\n<p>\"So we (also) hold fundraisers for the local schools, free yoga in the backyard, and we even offered free art classes for kids, on the weekends last summer.\"</p>\r\n<p>Check out the different events that are going on at Father Knows Best every night, as well as its menu, by visiting <a href=\"http://www.fathersbk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.fathersbk.com</a>.</p>\r\n<p>While you&rsquo;re at it, be sure to follow us on our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/outpostclubNY/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2yKHwih\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram</a>!</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/p0CTcu27htI?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Outpost_Recommends/20180228_125843_1519934246181.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-4)\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-5), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Outpost_Recommends/20180228_130322_1519933883321.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-5)\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-6), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Outpost_Recommends/20180228_130353_1519934614017.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-6)\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-7), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Outpost_Recommends/20180228_130645_1519933521050.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-7)\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-8), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Outpost_Recommends/20180228_130823_1519933685277.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-8)\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-9), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Outpost_Recommends/20180301_134641_1519931724111.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Recommends: Father Knows Best (Image-9)\" /></p>\r\n</div>', '20180301_134900_1519931136308-1.jpg', 1, '2018-03-05 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

I came to NYC for an internship, in my last year of school. I work in television, like a journalist, and I write reports and magazine articles for a French channel!</p>\r\n<p><strong>What brought you to NYC?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Haha sorry for repeating. I came for an internship with Independent Production Society, for a French television channel.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What has been your best experience here?</strong></p>\r\n<p>For now, I think my best experience here is meeting different people with different cultures!</p>\r\n<p><strong>What do you think of coliving?</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is a pretty good experience when you arrive in a new city where you know nobody! With coliving it is easier to meet new friends, and feel good in a new place! It&rsquo;s like getting a new family!</p>\r\n<p><strong>What\'s been your best experience in the time you have stayed </strong><strong>with</strong><strong> Outpost?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Hmm.. I think it&rsquo;s the <a href=\"../blog/outpost-enjoys-the-sun-with-a-bbq-party\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBQ</a> in March. Because there were a lot of people with different personalities, and we ate really great food!

But you don\'t have to travel all the way to Ireland to get a feel of the festivity. Just suit yourself up in green attire and join in the parade that will start at 11am. The participants will march up from the 44th Street all the way to the 79th Street. Along the way - on the 50th Street to be exact - you will get to see the St. Patrick\'s Cathedral. The parade is expected to end at 5.00pm, just about the time that happy hour starts!</p>\r\n<h2>Asia Week New York</h2>\r\n<p>The Asia Week New York is taking place from the 15th to the 24th of March.

I was born in Kinshasa, it is the capital city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. My family and I immigrated to the United States when I was eight years old. Prior to moving to New York City, I was living in North Carolina. I am the youngest of five children, I have two older brothers and two older sisters. I studied abroad twice when I was in college; I really love traveling and learning about different cultures.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Member Profile Gloria Mesa (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Member_GloriaMesa/tmp_2018041609393568249.jpg\" alt=\"Member Profile Gloria Mesa (Image-1)\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>What brought you to NYC?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I am completing a service year program with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in Brooklyn.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What has been your best experience here?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There is no other place in the world like New York City. I love how this city has so much to offer and there is always something to do. My best experience here so far has been being able to explore all the different boroughs and learning about the different cultures. One of my favorite places that I have discovered is the Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market. It is a beautiful market that has a lot of unique items.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What do you think of co-living?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I think it is a great option for folks who moved to the city alone. It allows you to meet a lot of different people that can become a part of your support system. As great and beautiful New York City is, it is quite common to also feel lonely while living here. Co-living creates a space for you to be able to meet others and formulate good friendships.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Member Profile Gloria Mesa (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/Member_GloriaMesa/pic%2B9-2.jpg\" alt=\"Member Profile Gloria Mesa (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>What\'s been your best experience in the time you have stayed with Outpost?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I love coming home and having someone there present to talk about how my day was. It has been a refreshing experience to meet so many people from all over the world. I enjoy having conversations with other people and learning about what they are passionate about and what thrives them to be the best version of themselves. I have made some friends with some members who stayed with Outpost and we have remained in contact even after they left and that has been pretty awesome.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are the 5 fun things we should know about you?</strong></p>\r\n<p>1.

Nothing left to talk about but the next meal you&rsquo;re going to prepare? No problem! Try these virtual activities with your friends to liven up your hangouts.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Reinvent the old games</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many of the classic games and game shows can be adapted to a video conferencing format. Get all your friends on a call together and try playing virtual bingo, Pictionary or even just create a quiz for you all to play. It may take some creativity but most games can be played live online, especially if you and a friend both have the same board games lying round the house.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Try out new games</strong></h1>\r\n<p>There are also plenty of games which can be played online and let you interact with other players live, such as Animal Crossing*, some versions of The Sims* and Call of Duty*. This combines all the fun of sitting at home and geeking out in lockdown with the chance to actually bond and hang out with your friends. And if you&rsquo;re looking for something truly interactive, we love Jackbox* games which allows you to each play the same game against friends on your phone while video calling each other.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Watch a movie together</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://netflix.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netflix</a> now has a new function where you can watch online with a friend. Been meaning to catch that movie together before lockdown set in? Now you can. It&rsquo;s a great way to wallow in your PJs and actually feel social at the same time, as you can exchange witty remarks and shocking tidbits live with your friend over the video while you watch.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Dress up together</strong></h1>\r\n<p>One of the frustrating things about being at home is that there&rsquo;s nothing to get dressed up for anymore. But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way! Why not dress up with your friends&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s a themed party (we know you have a drawer filled with costumes at home somewhere) or a night of pure glam, it&rsquo;s sure to get everybody having a good time. Or better yet, why not all wear that outfit that you love but you never get the chance to wear? From medieval banquet dresses to cosplay outfits to ballgowns, the possibilities of your closet are just waiting to be explored.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Get cooking</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems like everyone is cooking in quarantine like never before. But you&rsquo;re cooking doesn&rsquo;t have to be a solo enterprise. Simply arrange with friends to get the same ingredients and follow the same recipe and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a party. Hangout on video conference while you chop, saut&eacute;, fry, bake and wait and then look forward to eating your concoctions together at the same time. You can even make it a competition if you&rsquo;re looking for a challenge (although the points will have to be on presentation only, unless you trust your friends to honestly self-report on their own meal&rsquo;s taste!)</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Do a scavenger hunt</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us have many of the same objects lying around their houses, so why not take advantage of this and make it into a fun quarantine game with friends to play over video chat? Set a timed challenge for the first person to find a toothbrush, the first person to bring back a chopped carrot&mdash;or anything else. You can even scramble up words into anagrams to make the scavenger hunt harder or go the whole way and create an elaborate game with&nbsp;different stages and checkpoints for you all to reach.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Get arty</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So long as you and your friends all have the same arts and crafts tools, there&rsquo;s no limit to the arty activities you can get up to on a video call while you catch up with each other. Whether it&rsquo;s knitting, jewelry making or anything else, it&rsquo;s always better to do your hobbies with friends on the other end of the line. You could even work on your drawing skills by taking turns to draw portraits of one another. Anything you make will be a living memory to this difficult, bizarre time of your life&mdash;when hopefully you got the chance to bond virtually with your friends despite the distance.</span><br /><br /></p>', '2_16.jpg', 1, '2020-04-20 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

It reminded me of MTV Real World the first day I walked into the Outpost house at Flatbush! Such a diverse group, it&rsquo;s pretty cool to be around.

Eventually, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll want that back, but for now, I&rsquo;m lovin it!</p>\r\n<p><strong>What\'s been your best experience in the time you have stayed with Outpost?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Good question, we have done a lot of things since I&rsquo;ve been here! We just had a 90s party that was a lot of fun! I haven&rsquo;t had a house party like that in a while, it was perfect nostalgia and good times!</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are the 5 fun things we should know about you?</strong></p>\r\n<p>1) I&rsquo;m stoked for an upcoming trip to Colombia<br />2) I am a Latino that can&rsquo;t speak Spanish or dance a good Salsa (I am working hard on both!)<br />3) I am also a writer and independent filmmaker<br />4) my pen name is CV Ward<br />5) I have just released a short teaser comic on Facebook!

It was there that he met the child whose tragic story would change the direction of his own life.</p>\r\n<p>Brown said he could tell upon meeting him that the boy was struggling, but it wasn&rsquo;t until he found out weeks later that the child had passed away that he realized something had to change.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve helped him and I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;I said to myself, &ldquo;Bro, you&rsquo;re out here making money and living on the Upper West Side, and you&rsquo;re not doing anything to help people of color.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>That realization has led Brown to work tirelessly to get in a position to help people of color bridge the gap between the systemic racism that often holds them back and the change he knows they&rsquo;re capable of effecting -- but he&rsquo;s followed a long and winding road to get to where he is today.</p>\r\n<p>The venture capitalist, affective AI engineer and <a href=\"../\" target=\"_blank\">Outpost Club</a> member grew up in South London in an area he describes as &ldquo;similar to the south side of the Bronx.&rdquo; His father worked hard to provide for his family, he said, but times were difficult and the family struggled to stay afloat.</p>\r\n<p>His father saw the kind of promise in the United States that has drawn millions to upend their lives for the hope of something better since the first generation of English immigrants settled Jamestown in 1607.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;It was good timing because economically there was a lot of struggle,&rdquo; </strong><em>Brown said.</em><strong> &ldquo;All of us were like, &ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;re going all-in on this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"How Micah Brown Became a Venture Capitalist at Outpost Club (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/micahbrown2.png\" alt=\"How Micah Brown Became a Venture Capitalist at Outpost Club (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Brown eventually returned to London to work until he could afford to move himself and his family to New York, where he decided to get into media. If the child in Baltimore was the catalyst for Brown&rsquo;s desire to make a difference in the lives of people of color, it was his experience in the media industry, watching people of color being shut out but failing to raise his voice in support, that laid the foundation for what he is doing today.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Once I was the only other person of color in the room holding a high-profile black director back (from a deal),&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Without the benefit of my insight (as another person of color) into the impact that this director&rsquo;s idea would have on the media landscape, the numbers didn\'t add up in terms of ROI -- but I knew that the world needed this TV show.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The show later became one of the biggest shows on TV, but in that moment I held this person back and I was the only other person of color in the room,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I felt like I was saying I cared about helping black people and yet I literally just stopped a high-profile, proven black director from bringing an authentic black story to TV.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So he quit.</p>\r\n<p>He knew he wanted to build his own company and he knew he needed it to be a money-maker if he wanted to be able to accomplish his real dream, to help people and the community. He and his team worked long hours to launch <a href=\"https://filmfundr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">FilmFundr</a>, which in part uses emotional valuation to allow potential investors to quantify the economic value of media. It was piloted with multiple film studios, media companies and universities, and went through the <a href=\"https://batchery.com/startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batchery Accelerator</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The entrepreneur, perpetually cheerful with an excited glint in his eye, has a habit of speaking quickly when he tells you about something he cares deeply about; his words tumble out as though one can scarcely wait for the next in his excitement to share a story. It&rsquo;s infectious, and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that inspires people to share his vision.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that you need more than just vision and charisma to succeed. Brown had moved back in with his parents in Long Island after burning through his cash and later crashed on a friends&rsquo; couch while he tried to figure out his next move. That&rsquo;s where he was when he launched <a href=\"https://centiment.io/beta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Centiment</a>, marketing software that uses artificial intelligence and neurodata to help clients connect with their customers. It was tough-going at first, though.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sitting in this space, broke after trying to raise money for a year<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/founders-privilege-doing-everything-nothing-ainsley-patrick-brown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">,</a> sleeping on a friend&rsquo;s couch, and I&rsquo;m depressed, thinking, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t really do this anymore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My cofounder Tim, from London, had been working with me for two years for free.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It was in that mindset that Ken Lang found Brown at 4 a.m. one day, coding and trying to figure out how to turn his work into something more.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I spent four hours showing him this code,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like &lsquo;cool&rsquo; and leaves, never told me who he was. Then in the next few days his lawyer contacts me. He literally wired me the money within a couple of days. That&rsquo;s what really kicked everything off.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It was a busy time. Centiment won 11th place in an MIT competition and ended up with a neuroscience partnership sponsored by Sprint. They hired 20 City University students of color and helped 300 more find employment. The company partnered with IBM as a With Watson company started getting the attention of national and industry media as it received investments in 2017 from Sprint and the Black and Latino Tech initiative.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"How Micah Brown Became a Venture Capitalist at Outpost Club (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/micahbrown3.png\" alt=\"How Micah Brown Became a Venture Capitalist at Outpost Club (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>It was during this time that Brown was trying to transition his life back to New York City. That&rsquo;s when he found Outpost Club.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;The flexibility (Outpost) offered at this period was a direct help,&rdquo; </strong><em>he said.</em><strong> &ldquo;The community was a really interesting contribution too; there&rsquo;s a practicality and, I&rsquo;d say, a New York ruggedness to Outpost Club. The nature of people at Outpost is that they&rsquo;re all fighting to accomplish something.&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n<p>Brown believes your environment helps determine your success, and the organization and structure of Outpost Club has made a big difference to him. And according to Jacob Shapiro, Outpost Club&rsquo;s New York Account Manager, that&rsquo;s a major draw for many members. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always appealed to people who are coming from outside of New York to make it in New York, and most people haven&rsquo;t made it yet,&rdquo; </strong><em>he said</em><strong>. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the process of trying to create a stable lifestyle in New York City.&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n<p>Now that Brown knows his direction, he can focus on the details: getting some of the world&rsquo;s $182 Billion in investment capital dedicated to the projects of people of color. As of 2018, less than one percent of that goes to projects started by people of color; only 0.2 percent of the of the U.S<a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-capital-q4-2017/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">.</a> money goes to women of color.</p>\r\n<p>Brown said people of color are so used to struggling to find investors that many have been forced to learn to operate on a shoestring budget. That includes him: Centiment built $5m worth of software with only $100K. If people of color could get more funding, though, they could have a big impact on the face of tech -- especially in areas like artificial intelligence and neuroscience, which have seen a huge surge in capital over the past year.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The only way to get effective AI is a massive spend on testing or using neuroscience for your consumer products,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;So in that second category, what our technology does is shorten the research process.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>New opportunities for his earlier project have come into play as he&rsquo;s worked on Centiment, all while staying at <a href=\"../the-downtown-brooklyn-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outpost Club&rsquo;s Downtown Brooklyn House</a>. FilmFundr was acquired by Battery Park Entertainment in the fourth quarter of 2018.</p>\r\n<p>His team has now formed <a href=\"http://centimentcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Centiment Capital</a>, creating AI that has the ability to forecast company valuations. Centiment is raising a $5-million fund to take the next steps toward helping empower people of color: actually getting the money into the hands of those who can use it. He said he&rsquo;s in this to demonstrate to other VCs, angel investors and private investors in neuroscience, deep tech and AI that such investments are worth it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;My story is the first undeniable example that it can be done -- I put the work in and the struggle was there and now the results are there,&rdquo; </strong><em>he said</em><strong>. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deny it. I&rsquo;m here to help other people of color do what I&rsquo;ve done by investing in them and fighting for them.&rdquo; </strong></p>', 'micahbrown.png', 1, '2018-11-06 06:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 0),

Professionally speaking, all my experience is rooted here and my contacts are based here.</p>\r\n<p>Personally speaking, somebody told me a while back that I had to live somewhere where I can imagine a future. I can do that here, and live every second of the present to the fullest.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>What do you do?</h3>\r\n<p>Well, I stay busy.</p>\r\n<p>Besides my work with Outpost Club I also work in the Publicity and Marketing department at the New Press, a nonprofit publishing company that publishes extremely powerful social justice and historical books. Some of the books that have changed the course of American social movement building and public discourse in the past few years have come from TNP, namely Michelle Alexander&rsquo;s <em>The New Jim Crow</em>, so it&rsquo;s a dream to work with them and continue the legacy.</p>\r\n<p>And outside of that I&rsquo;m still doing some freelance design work, primarily focusing on book design which is a huge passion area for me.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the average weekday in Ridgewood like for you?</h3>\r\n<p>I try to get up as early as possible - which my roommate can tell you doesn&rsquo;t happen all the time. Then it&rsquo;s coffee, a spot of breakfast, and heading out to work. Coming back in the evenings there&rsquo;s a brief moment of rest, before making some dinner right around when everyone else starts to show up. We have a pretty big space (especially by city standards), so there&rsquo;s still a bit of bumping elbows in the kitchen but it&rsquo;s easy to sit together and chat over dinner. Then some evening work, sometimes a walk around the neighborhood and a bodega stop, talk over the day with my roommate, and eventually pass out.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>One thing you love about co-living</h3>\r\n<p>This is a lot for an introvert to say, but I actually love the social aspect. It&rsquo;s been incredible to share a house and a room with people who are just as passionate about the work they do. I didn&rsquo;t know how much of a relief it would be to be able to share a co-working space with others and get the chance to talk through ideas or problems, and then spend the weekend together (hopefully) doing less work and taking in what the city has to offer.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>A favorite city Spot and one place you want to explore</h3>\r\n<p>I know it&rsquo;s a cliche, but one of my favorite spots is Bryant Park. It&rsquo;s easy to get to, a great place to relax and people watch, and I can always get work done in the library.</p>\r\n<p>A place I&rsquo;m looking forward to checking out is Greenwood Cemetery. Weird, I know. But it&rsquo;s a gorgeous place, and there&rsquo;s a surprising number of cool events for the living.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', '485145_516368118406864_1390879179_n.jpg', 1, '2018-06-03 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Growing up as the son of a former Brooklynite, Caleb had heard plenty of stories about Brooklyn block parties, but what he saw on Saturday completely exceeded his expectations.</p>\r\n<p>Not only did Caleb love the event, he mentioned that Outpost played a huge role in being able to enjoy the day:</p>\r\n<p>\"I was going with people I already knew. What if I had moved into some studio or one bedroom apartment in the city?

A journalist, a techie, and an entrepreneur, Caleb\'s only been an Outpost Member since February but he\'s got a lot to say about his experience so far.</p>\r\n<div><img title=\"#MemberMonday: Caleb Simmons (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/MemberMonday_CALEB_SIMMONS/DSC00038.jpg\" alt=\"#MemberMonday: Caleb Simmons (Image-1)\" /></div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Tell us a little bit about yourself</h3>\r\n<p>By day I\'m a digital journalist on block and chain cryptocurrency, have been for three years now for a variety of outlets (Huffington Post, Silicon NYC, and Grit Daily to name a few).</p>\r\n<p>By night, you could say, I\'m&nbsp;a start-up entrepreneur. I own two companies, one is called Homecoming, and we\'re the birthright experience for African Americans. Our goal is to help African Americans take a trip to countries on the African continent to get a better feel for the culture, the connection to the heritage of multiple countries in Africa, and get a firmer sense of their value to the world in the context of their ancestor origins. The second company I own is called ScrollGrade, and we\'re a member of the startup incubator called Blackstone Launchpad at NYU. Our app allows educators to grade short answer written work in 85% less time, and next we hope to drill down on our project roadmap and refining our business plan before we move to beta testing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>What Brought You Here?</h3>\r\n<p>I started working as a contributor to the Huffington Post in 2015 and it was a time I began to question whether I wanted to start building a life in New York or if I wanted to remain in New Jersey and just work from home. And it didn\'t manifest overnight. In 2016 I was asked to work for an outlet called Silicon NYC, and I came to realization that most of what I was doing and what I wanted to do was in New York, and that my time would be better served here.</p>\r\n<p>But I didn\'t find out about Outpost Club until I attended the 2017 NYC EdTech Festival, which is a three day convention with an expo, panels, discussions, and speeches about new technology in the education space. So, on the last day I went to the expo and Sergeii and Jacob were there representing Outpost Club. So, I went over asked about what they did, and they answered some questions and gave me the brochure. I just really liked the affordability and the community minded focus, and just how serendipitous it was that they were in this space and displaying their solution to a need I had.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>What\'s your most important Job as house leader?</h3>\r\n<p>I\'ve really enjoyed the experience, although it\'s taken a bit of getting used to. I feel that house leader is sort of an example for the rest of the house in terms of doing chores, taking care of the dishes, and making sure everything is going well. But I also think the house leader is responsible for making sure the social environment is healthy for everyone. You hear roommate horror stories everywhere, and I feel like it\'s part of my job to make sure those stories aren\'t formed here.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>One thing you\'re looking forward to in the next few months?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>There\'s a gym called Brooklyn Zoo, and it\'s a Parkour gym. What I\'ve wanted to do is have an event where I bring Outpost members to the Brooklyn Zoo because I think it\'s a great full body discipline, and, in a somewhat extreme sense, navigating New York if only by hand and foot.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>What are you going to miss the most about OutPost</h3>\r\n<p>My god, that\'s hard. I think just the social and material convenience of it all.

I came to NYC for a Beverage Internship with Gramercy Tavern. Union Square Hospitality Group is a leader in this country for service, beverage programing and social justice working hand in hand with hospitality. I work a lot! I also am associated with City Winery. I was the Restaurant Manager at the Atlanta location so I was lucky that they let me stay with the company and lend a hand in service. They are also a leader in beverage programming as they are an urban winery and the NYC location is up for a Wine Spectator Grand Award. So I am pretty lucky to surround myself with some of the world&rsquo;s best wines!</p>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3>What brought you here?</h3>\r\n<div>What brought me to NYC as I mentioned above is to work with and for the best in the hospitality industry. &nbsp;I hope to take many of the strong lessons back with me to Atlanta and get to help be a driving force in our local industry. I came to Outpost because it was easy! I have a life back home and I couldn&rsquo;t be up here looking for an apartment with all my money&hellip;.I had to work up until I came. So after a lot of frustrating research I came across this listing and it seemed perfect. And so far I have been really happy with my choice.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3>What\'s the one thing you\'re going to miss the most when you leave Outpost?</h3>\r\n<div>I am really going to miss all the people. There are so many folks from all over the world doing incredible things. I can be on my own but there is always someone to talk to and hang out with. I just feel really lucky to have such a diverse house.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3>Why did you decide to become a house leader, and what&rsquo;s been the best part about the job?</h3>\r\n<div>I wanted to become a House Leader to bring stability as well as a clear direction to the house. It seems silly but there are still a few adults that don&rsquo;t know how to load a dishwasher! I like to keep an orderly house so having the responsibility to keep our house looking its best is a good match for me. Plus I am going to be running monthly wine tasting gatherings so I get to share my knowledge and love of wine!&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>Do you have a favorite spot in the city? Or one place you want to explore more?</h3>\r\n<div>So far I must confess I haven&rsquo;t gotten a chance to explore too much&hellip;working constantly! But I do love Cobble Hill. My new favorite bookstore and wine bar are down the street from each other. So that is reason enough to have a favorite spot. But my walk from Gramercy Tavern to City Winery NYC through Greenwich and Washington Square feels pretty quintessential NYC.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Follow up with Devan and see more about her work by following her on insta: @devanknobloch.

Like any co-working space, BKLYN Commons covers all the basics with scanning and printing services, high-speed internet, and completely furnished offices and conference rooms. Complimentary coffee, tea, and filtered water are available at all times in the fully stocked kitchen, and there are ping-pong and foosball tables throughout the building for when you need to catch a break. Whether you&rsquo;re an early bird or a night owl you can access your office or shared desk space whenever is most convenient for you with your 24/7 access, and from 9-5 onsite staff are on hand to answer any questions and offer reception services for any guests you may entertain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"#MemberMonday: BKLYN Commons (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/MemberMonday_BKLYN_Commons/IMG_1625.jpg\" alt=\"#MemberMonday: BKLYN Commons (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But BKLYN Commons separates itself from other co-working spaces through its dedication to community and creating opportunities for members to organically develop meaningful and authentic relationships. The social calendar for both locations are always full, with at least one major monthly networking event and smaller gatherings throughout the week. Every week kicks off with the community breakfast where members can get ready for the week together over a light meal. Members also have the opportunity to catch up later in the week with the community happy hour, or during one of the grander monthly networking events - like the one coming up this Thursday.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, BKLYN Commons members don&rsquo;t have to wait for an event to socialize. With three floors of offices and shared space there is always a chance to meet someone new and always an opportunity to launch an new business relationship. We spoke with Nicholas Smith, General Manager, who brilliantly summed up the BKLYN Commons experience by saying it&rsquo;s the business of connections and networking. Smith told us there are plenty of offices that hold open office hours and invite other members to drop in and see what services are offered and what collaborations can be built. With a combination of solo entrepreneurs and established companies and nonprofits, partnerships are constantly evolving and businesses always growing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"#MemberMonday: BKLYN Commons (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/MemberMonday_BKLYN_Commons/IMG_1611.jpg\" alt=\"#MemberMonday: BKLYN Commons (Image-3)\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now - to the good news for Outpost Members.

The ever growing parade kicked off at noon and traveled over 30 blocks with over a thousand floats, marchers, and organizations that drew in a crowd of over two million spectators.</p>\r\n<p>This was fifth pride for Manon Lorre, Ridgewood House member. Manon came from Paris, France to be a part of <strong>Steps on Broadway</strong>, a three-month intensive program that offered classes and training in multiple styles of dancing, ranging from ballet and jazz to contemporary and tap. Although she&rsquo;s just finishing her time in New York this week, she&rsquo;ll be coming back next year to continue her training in dance and choreography.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/OutpostClub_Pride/36336052_2211162869115644_3573993525684994048_n.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<h4>Can you walk us through what the day was like? What did you see, what did you do?</h4>\r\n<p>We arrived at Union Square in the early afternoon. At first, we walked through the Pride Fest with all its stands giving away free merch - that was a fun part. The place was so crowded that we could barely walk, but I rather enjoyed it. We don&rsquo;t have such a &ldquo;village&rdquo; for pride in Paris. After having lunch, I joined my friends to watch the parade. I was impressed: the parade itself was big. There was so many organizations marching, I was there at 6pm and we did not see all of it. I really enjoyed the day, meeting so many LGBT people, I had a lot of fun.</p>\r\n<h4>So, you&rsquo;ve attended Pride in the past. Can you tell us where, and how PrideNYC matched up to those previous experiences?</h4>\r\n<p>Yes! One in Dublin, Ireland, and three in Paris. It is quite different from New York, even if there&rsquo;s quite the same atmosphere, because you can actually march with the people. There is no restriction, no signing to join, you can just march. It was quite frustrating actually because when I go to Pride in my mind I&rsquo;m going to march. The size of course, can&rsquo;t be compared.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Why is Pride such an important event to you?</h4>\r\n<p>Since I am part of the LGBT community myself, I did not want to miss the event. But more than that, I think that it&rsquo;s an important day to remember LGBT people and LGBT issues. It&rsquo;s the one event in the year that a LGBT person would not miss, definitely.</p>\r\n<h4>How did going with Outpost change the feeling of the event for you? Why did you decide to join Outpost in the first place?</h4>\r\n<p>I decided to join Outpost because I didn&rsquo;t know anyone in New York, and it seemed like the most convenient and cost-effective option. But I think making the event was a great idea to bring Outpost LGBT people together, who might not know each other. A lot of Outpost members are new to NYC, this type of event allows LGBT people not to be alone on that special day.I also think it is a great thing if straight people come in support of pride. It&rsquo;s a great experience for everyone, and you could leave with less prejudice towards LGBT people.</p>\r\n<h4>Will you be going again?</h4>\r\n<p>Yes, of course, every year! Maybe not always in New York, but any pride.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/OutpostClub_Pride/Untitled-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-3)\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/OutpostClub_Pride/Untitled-4-1.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-4)\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-5), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/OutpostClub_Pride/Untitled-2-3.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-5)\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-6), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/OutpostClub_Pride/Untitled-7-1.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Club at #Pride (Image-6)\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Kinda feel like you missed out now?

I also play piano, play squash and tennis, and came to New York to choose a school and apply for MBA. Honestly, one can apply from any spot on planet Earth, but I just missed the city I used to live in five years ago.</p>\r\n<h3>What brought you here?</h3>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve lived with Outpost for 2 months, and it&rsquo;s for my friend&rsquo;s advice that I choose to join the community. We were chatting at a birthday party and I said I&rsquo;m moving to NY for some time and my friend described his stay in Outpost half a year before me.</p>\r\n<p>New York is a unique blend of all particulars of the world. There is nothing on the planet that isn&rsquo;t presented in the city. Everybody finds something for herself.</p>\r\n<h3>What have you grown to love about Outpost, and what do you think you\'ll miss the most when you leave?</h3>\r\n<p>Outpost caught my attention at first because it saves time and energy by taking care of all house-related issues for you &mdash; I don&rsquo;t ever think what is going on with my internet (netflix/prime video/hulu/etc.) bill, gas/electricity bills, will I ran out of toilet paper in the worst possible time and did I buy shampoo to wash my hair before that spontaneous date. NY is extremely high-paced city and the last city you want to lose your time over taking care of such non-essential tasks. Time is a value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now I also see value in the community itself &mdash; we meet over barbecues, brunches, yoga classes, we share views, experiences &mdash; that enriches our opinions, furthermore, if you don&rsquo;t have any plans or if you don&rsquo;t have friends on the city yet &mdash; you find yourself in a nutritious and friendly environment that builds your healthy state of mind in a socially challenging megapolis.</p>\r\n<h3>Why did you decide to become a house leader, and what&rsquo;s been the best part about the job?</h3>\r\n<p>I became a house leader in <a href=\"../the-bed-stuy-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bed-Stuy house</a> partly because I needed to water down, so to say, my constant studying and working and and by and large because I found the management team super bright and wanted to be involved in the life of the community, to influence in some good way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Do you have a favorite spot in the city? Or one place you want to explore more?</h3>\r\n<p>The favorite spot in the city&hellip; This year no spots excite me much in the city, I got used to many things by now. New York itself is greatly photogenic place, Empire State building is my life-long love, Chrysler building would be second, though my favorite place is at friend&rsquo;s private house with a pier where we eat the most tasty food and meet the most spectacular sunsets. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>To chat more with Barbara and the rest of Outpost Club request to join our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/outpostclub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook group</a>,&nbsp;and don\'t forget to keep up with our <a href=\"../blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog</a>!</strong></p>', 'v-21.jpeg', 1, '2018-07-01 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Tacia Duarte, Outpost Community Manager, established this connection and has been working with Dasha ever since.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to create an environment for people who like doing healthy things, and sometimes it&rsquo;s an open door for new and other activities,&rdquo; Tacia says of the events. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a good experience with this type of event, even with people who have never done yoga. And it&rsquo;s just a good opportunity to have everyone together.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Sputnik Yoga was founded in 2017 to offer yoga for &ldquo;everyBODY&rdquo; and meet the needs of students, instructors, and the greater health community in NYC through innovative and affordable classes. To meet these aims Sputnik Yoga brings yoga outside the confines of the traditional studio, an environment Dasha and her colleagues realized can be quite intimidating for new students. Studios aren&rsquo;t always the best place for new instructors either - many are asked to work for little to no pay without any guarantee of permanent placement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where the rooftop yoga parties come in&hellip; Sputnik Yoga makes great use of underutilized retail spaces to bring its classes to a wider range of participants, like the rooftop at our <a href=\"../the-east-bushwick-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">East Bushwick House</a>!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"#MemberMonday: Dasha and Sputnik Yoga (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/MemberMonday_Dasha/Untitled-1-8.jpg\" alt=\"#MemberMonday: Dasha and Sputnik Yoga (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<p>But Sputnik Yoga doesn&rsquo;t just reach out to retail businesses for partnerships. Staying true to their mission of making yoga available for all, Sputnik reaches out to charities and non-profit organizations throughout the city to provide classes and wellness activities to those in need. Even their routine community classes are set in a &ldquo;pay what you can&rdquo; structure so that no one is ever turned down at an event or class. Personal experience drives this practice, as all Sputnik instructors deeply understand that wellness is often what is most needed in difficult periods of life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"#MemberMonday: Dasha and Sputnik Yoga (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/MemberMonday_Dasha/Untitled-26.jpg\" alt=\"#MemberMonday: Dasha and Sputnik Yoga (Image-3)\" /></p>\r\n<p>That understanding doesn&rsquo;t make any class a serious or somber (or sober) affair, though. Sputnik Yoga is equally dedicated to making their classes fun, light, and not too serious by using themed classes like Yoga and Cocktails, Booty Yoga, or Rise and Shine. Part of what makes these events shine are the partnerships that Sputnik have developed with other companies, like Fj&auml;llR&auml;ven, Chameleon Coldbrew, Zico Coconut Water, and more. Outpost members are particular fans of the Sptunik&rsquo;s partnerships with Deep Eddy Vodka and GrandyOats who made our most recent Yoga and Cocktails event a huge success!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And it&rsquo;s a certain fact that there will be more of these successful events, and Tacia herself is very keen on continuing the relationship with Sputnik Yoga. When asked about how she sees the relationship growing she started by&nbsp; commending Sputnik itself. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very open and creative. [Dasha] has a lot of great partners, and Outpost can definitely take advantage of the whole concept [she] created.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Working with Dasha in particular has been the highlight for many members. Dasha has been leading the Wednesday community classes that members have attended for months, and is the instructor for our private rooftop yoga events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"#MemberMonday: Dasha and Sputnik Yoga (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/MemberMonday_Dasha/Dasha-1.jpg\" alt=\"#MemberMonday: Dasha and Sputnik Yoga (Image-4)\" /><br />Photo Credit: @SputnikYoga</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;She has a very good energy, which is essential for this type of event,&rdquo; Tacia says of our favorite instructor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also good to have people that have experience and know others. She does events all over the city, so she knows people, places, and brings that culture to us so we get the chance to know as well. When we connect with partners like that our members get to know new products and new places. That kind of knowledge is so important to building and growing our community.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>We love our experience with Sputnik Yoga, and Dasha, we love the fact that we get a private yoga class on our own rooftop with beautiful sunset views, and we <strong>love</strong> the fact our next event is coming up August 4th!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Make sure you follow up with Dasha and Sputnik Yoga on their website.

We&rsquo;re about building community, creating a simple housing process in New York, and we&rsquo;re all about coliving.</p>', '<p>By now, you should know what Outpost is all about. We&rsquo;re about building community, creating a simple housing process in New York, and we&rsquo;re all about coliving.</p>\r\n<h3>So, you might ask, what exactly is coliving?</h3>\r\n<p>Just googling &ldquo;What is Coliving&rdquo; will turn up a front page of articles and blog posts written about other coliving networks about <em>their </em>definition of coliving. Other hits throw coworking into the mix, and even more common search results describe the evolution of the &ldquo;sharing economy&rdquo; and how current startups play into that development.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re definitely not throwing down the definitive answer on what coliving is, and we&rsquo;re not looking to just add to the infinite list of search results. We want to develop an understanding of what coliving is with you, our members. We want to create a fluid definition of coliving that grows with us and fulfills our mission of creating vibrant and passionate communities.</p>\r\n<h3>Let&rsquo;s start with the basics.</h3>\r\n<p>At its very core coliving is a shared housing model. Tenants (called \"Members\" at Outpost), live in a home where common areas like kitchens, living rooms, laundry office spaces, laundry facilities, and sometimes bathrooms are shared. Some coliving spaces even offer a mix of shared room styles, like at <a href=\"../\" rel=\"nofollow\">seven of our eight</a> houses.</p>\r\n<p>The structure of a coliving house alone may appeal to some, but the standard amenities included with the cost of coliving is what really draws tenants. For one thing, the cost of coliving is typically more affordable than subletting or renting on your own in any city. Coliving also comes with more flexible terms and leases, ranging anywhere from one-month stays to a full year. With most coliving operations your monthly fees include a bit more than just the cost of your stay, and Outpost in particular stretches that budget pretty far.</p>\r\n<p>Your monthly <a href=\"../memberships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">membership fees at Outpost Club</a> covers all your utilities, high-speed internet, 24/7 security in all common areas, twice weekly cleanings of every home, fully equipped kitchens, professionally designed and furnished common and living spaces, and constant restocking of your kitchen and bathroom essentials including everything from coffee and seasonings, to soap and shampoo.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"What is Coliving (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/What_is_Coliving/2.jpg\" alt=\"What is Coliving (Image-1)\" /></p>\r\n<p>This is where the technical definition of \"coliving\" ends. Honestly, it\'s where a lot of coliving operations do stop. But there\'s an entirely different aspect of coliving that can\'t be priced: community. And while community can grow naturally in these environments, we wanted to be more intentional with our houses and communities at Outpost Club. We know that sometimes even in a room full of people you can feel alone, and we definitely know the New York hustle - wake up, commute to work, grab your coffee, put in your hours, commute back home, check your email, text some friends, pass out... This lifestyle can be horribly isolating, even in the most densely populated city in the country.</p>\r\n<h4>That\'s why Outpost Club is dedicated to not just providing affordable housing options, but instant communities with opportunities to socialize, network and grow.</h4>\r\n<p>To meet that goal we\'ve developed outings, events, and activities that focus on bringing people out and connected with others. Our calendar is brimming with something for everyone, whether you\'re looking for a chill night to watch a movie or play board games at the house, test your core strength with yoga classes, hit the beach, or throw a party and a barbecue, we\'ve got you covered.</p>\r\n<p>And we mean literally covered - your monthly membership fee grants you access to any event at an Outpost house.</p>\r\n<p>Our dedication to fostering community is embedded in everything we do, right down to the very structure and design of every individual house. East Williamsburg hosts a large patio for all our barbecues and parties, Ridgewood sports the largest living room and TV for movie and game nights, and our brand new Downtown Brooklyn House has the largest finished rooftop deck where we\'ll be hosting all our future rooftop Yoga and Cocktail events.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"What is Coliving (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/What_is_Coliving/1.jpg\" alt=\"What is Coliving (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<h3>So, let\'s get back to our original question. What is coliving?</h3>\r\n<p>Emma Fox, current resident of East Williamsburg, weighed in and gave us this answer:<em><strong> \"It\'s sharing a space with people in the sense of actually sharing. It\'s not like living </strong></em>on<em><strong> the same city block as someone, it\'s inhabiting the same space as other people.\"</strong></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>\"Like, I could have commuted from around Philly, and I was looking at </em></strong>Airbnbs<strong><em> and subletting. [Outpost Club] was simpler, and it seemed nicer to have people around who were also in a transitional situation. And you feel more settled-in much faster. You have a greater sense of familiarity with the city than you would have if you just moved in anywhere.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>\"It feels more like home, much faster. It\'s pretty much ready-made familiarity.\"</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>That\'s what one of our members have to say about coliving, but we know you really want to hear what we at Outpost have to say. And for us, coliving is you - our members.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"What is Coliving (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/What_is_Coliving/Featured-Image-3.jpg\" alt=\"What is Coliving (Image-3)\" /></p>\r\n<p>Yeah, yeah, we know, very sappy. But it\'s the truth. We know that coliving could just be the technical term we defined above. It could just be shared housing at a great price with lots of amenities bundled up with it, but that\'s not what we set out to do. We wanted to build tight knit communities with shared passions and visions, and make the world we live in a better place starting from our very homes - and we can only do that with you.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>We\'re<strong> so excited to have you staying with us in this beautiful city of ours, for however long you choose to be here. And we want to hear from you - what\'s your definition of </strong>coliving<strong>?

I\'ve been in the speciality coffee industry for ten years, and that\'s what brought me to New York City.</p>\r\n<h3>How long have you been with outpost? What brought you here?</h3>\r\n<p>I\'ve been with Outpost for a month. I chose Outpost because I wanted a place where I could live safely as a trans nonbinary person without judgment, and also to make friends in a city where I didn\'t know anyone.</p>\r\n<h3>Can you describe your upcoming event with Outpost?</h3>\r\n<p>I\'m planning to show two different types of coffee brewing methods as well as a coffee cocktail, and explain the process of tasting coffee and all the notes that are in them.</p>\r\n<h3>What inspired the event you\'re going to host?</h3>\r\n<p>I love coffee and I love making it accessible to everyone, and sharing coffee with all of my roommates and housemates is a great way to do that.</p>\r\n<h3>What are you hoping to bring to the community with this event?</h3>\r\n<p>I aim hoping to increase [members\'] knowledge of what coffee can be as well as develop a palate for what the differences between good coffee and bad coffee and how you can learn to make bad coffee good</p>\r\n<h3>What\'s the best coffee spot you\'ve found in the city?</h3>\r\n<p>At Stumptown [I had a] horchata cold brew. It was a perfectly balanced flavorful beverage. It was sweet and creamy and very caffeinated and delicious</p>\r\n<h3>What\'s your story with coffee, and how has that story brought you to where you are today?</h3>\r\n<p>I started drinking coffee when I was three. My mom used to put it in my sippy cup and I would drink it on the way to pre-school every day. And as I got older, going to school, my mom worked at every school I went to and we always got ready together. It was our ritual to sit together and drink coffee and read the paper together, so I developed a love for drinking coffee and doing the crossword with my family. In high school I had a teacher who would reward our good grades with filed trips to Starbucks, and it was there I first learned what coffee can be, and that there was so much more than just adding cream and sugar. There was a moment in a coffee shop where someone made a French press for me and I learned there was a theatre to it. I no longer make coffee for people in the traditional sense. Now I roast coffee, and that\'s another part of the story. I enjoy that it has such a long journey before it gets to the customer, and that\'s what I love.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>You have to follow Lindsay on Instagram&nbsp;here and follow latest chapters of their story in New York with coffee!

She had the idea for Saturday&rsquo;s experience when she observed how much of our lives take place over our phones.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Some of the people there had never touched clay before that night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I figured faces are something everyone has a curiosity about, so I thought it would be a good way to get us out of this digital world we live in.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"What We Learned at Outpost\'s Blind Sculpting Party (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/what-we-learned-at-outposts-blind-sculpting-party/blind-sculpting-party-6.jpg\" alt=\"What We Learned at Outpost\'s Blind Sculpting Party (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>So the blindfolds came out and the Outpost Community got to work, molding clay into as close an approximation of the human face as one could be expected to create after having been blinded on short notice.</p>\r\n<p>In between drinks and dancing, partners traded off twisting and pressing the clay into something they thought they were intimately familiar with: their own face. One sense down, though, they realized it was harder than they&rsquo;d expected.</p>\r\n<p>Many people commented on how little they realized they knew about their own face.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"What We Learned at Outpost\'s Blind Sculpting Party (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/what-we-learned-at-outposts-blind-sculpting-party/blind-sculpting-party-5.jpg\" alt=\"What We Learned at Outpost\'s Blind Sculpting Party (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>That was kind of the point, according to Tacia. The sculptor said that&rsquo;s something she commonly experiences with her students: People think they have an intuitive knowledge of what a face should look like, but they can&rsquo;t always translate that through other senses.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We all have a very superficial understanding of the face that we see everyday,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I were to do the event again, it&rsquo;d be easier because everyone would have established a memory of what a face should look like, which is the tricky part.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We all have that memory,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a matter of training it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"What We Learned at Outpost\'s Blind Sculpting Party (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/what-we-learned-at-outposts-blind-sculpting-party/blind-sculpting-party-4.jpg\" alt=\"What We Learned at Outpost\'s Blind Sculpting Party (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>As drinks were downed and dancing took over the patio, 15 heads, faceless no more, stared out into the night, watching the wild abandon with sightless eyes.

Here are five tips for doing just that:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>PLAN YOUR MEALS BEFORE YOU GROCERY SHOP</h4>\r\n<p>How often do you think before you shop instead of grabbing things you can graze on and pantry staples and hoping for the best? <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jesseszewczyk/tasty-make-ahead-meal-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plenty</a> of <a href=\"https://delishably.com/food-industry/How-To-Plan-and-Prepare-Meals-for-One-Easy-Weekly-Menu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">guides</a> exist <a href=\"https://vitals.lifehacker.com/how-to-shop-cook-and-eat-healthy-when-eating-for-one-1749385732\" rel=\"nofollow\">online</a> to help you get a large variety of meals out of less food, meaning less shoving things into the back of the fridge and forgetting about them until cleaning day arrives.</p>\r\n<h4>USE YOUR LUGGAGE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE</h4>\r\n<p>Your luggage isn&rsquo;t living up to its full potential if it&rsquo;s not packed with your off-season clothing and belongings you don&rsquo;t use often but can&rsquo;t bear to part with. Sweater weather is going to be in Brooklyn full-time soon, which means opening up your closet by hiding away last season&rsquo;s shorts, sandals and tanks.</p>\r\n<h4>KEEP YOUR COMMON SPACES CLUTTER-FREE</h4>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to get to your breakfast dishes after work or to leave your homework on the kitchen table after a long night because you&rsquo;ll have to pack it up in the morning, anyway. With loads of different schedules in the same house, though, you never know when someone else will need to use the common areas. Generally speaking, if you aren&rsquo;t physically present in a common space, you&rsquo;re belongings shouldn&rsquo;t be, either.</p>\r\n<h4>DO A GROUP CLEAN-UP ONCE A MONTH</h4>\r\n<p>Sometimes life gets the best of us and our fridges, tables and counters take the worst hit. Not many of us would consider cleaning a hobby, but taking time each month to make sure nothing is getting out of hand means you&rsquo;ll never open the fridge to find something that looks like it crawled out of the bottom of the East River.</p>\r\n<p>Schedule a time once a month for the entire apartment to show up and help out, throw on some music and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and you&rsquo;ll be done in no time.</p>\r\n<h4>RESPECT YOUR ROOMMATES</h4>\r\n<p>No one wants to come home from work hungry only to realize they have to wash a bunch of pans before they can make dinner, or get out of bed in the morning and trip over clothing that&rsquo;s not theirs on the way to the bathroom. If you respect your roommates&rsquo; right to be comfortable and clean in their home, chances are that they&rsquo;ll respect yours.</p>\r\n<p>One of the great things about co-living is the community we get to form throughout our houses, and respecting one another makes for a better experience for everyone.</p>\r\n<p>Besides &mdash; the less time you have to spend cleaning or rifling around for your belongings, the more time you&rsquo;ll have to hang out and have a good time.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '5-tips-for-staying-organized-in-a-shared-space.jpg', 1, '2018-10-05 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Read on to learn about how Sky channels her creativity and find a special offer for Outpost members from Lab Studios.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF (AND YOUR ARTISTIC BACKGROUND)</h4>\r\n<p>I grew up in Houston, Texas, and just arrived in New York about three months ago. Houston has a huge part of my heart, but I\'ve always wanted to be in New York. The perception of Texas from the East Coast is interesting ... it\'s played out like its the wild, wild West, but in reality it nests significant artists and culture. There\'s everything from growing up around Chopped and Screwed music to experiencing James Turrell installations and Van Der Rohe architecture. That exposure to these artists has continued to contribute to my taste and style.</p>\r\n<p>My father was an artist but never ended up going to art school because my mom got pregnant with me. With that being said, I have been taught about the fundamentals of art since I was a little girl, with a \"you must know the rules to break them\" philosophy. I went to college for visual arts when I was fifteen, mostly experimenting with different mediums and figuring out what I like and don\'t like.</p>\r\n<p>I was mainly focused on painting but I knew there was something missing. That\'s when I was introduced to the idea of a creative director -- someone who handles all of the visual language of a production -- and it became really attractive to me. I was fascinated with being able to control every tiny detail of design and create a narrative.&nbsp;Being immersed in the art world has brought me opportunities to work on films, photoshoots, curation, company branding, modeling, and anything else I can create ideas for.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"#MemberMonday: Sky Mejias (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/member-monday/membermonday-sky-mejias-1.png\" alt=\"#MemberMonday: Sky Mejias (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h4>WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON NOW?</h4>\r\n<p>My friend and I started a magazine called <strong>usaphase.co</strong>&nbsp;and it\'s been almost three years. My motive for the magazine is to give recognition to artists that don\'t get recognized, and from there give those artists a platform to showcase their work.</p>\r\n<p>Once I moved to New York, a couple of friends that have been in Phase, my magazine, and I got together and started a photo studio called Lab Studios.</p>\r\n<h4>WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION BEHIND THE STUDIO?&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>We felt it was a innovative way to have our own space to create individually, but also lend out our space to other artists to execute their own work. Lab Studios is an all white, distraction-free canvas for you create. Lab is a photo- and film-focused production space that is rented hourly, although Lab accommodates cross-disciplined creatives; we welcome the space to be utilized in other ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>YOU\'VE SAID THAT OUTPOST HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON YOU.</h4>\r\n<p>My friend Ajani whom is one of the co-owners of Lab recommended outpost to Tosh (my boyfriend) and I. She told me that it\'s a great way to start in New York before you have an apartment and to create your network of artists. She was right; I have met many talented artists in the East Bushwick house. Therefore, Outpost has helped all of the owners of Lab Space to jumpstart their career in New York. We all thank Outpost!!</p>\r\n<h4><em>Outpost members can get a 50-percent discount to rent out the studio space for $55 per hour.&nbsp;If you\'re interested please email at <a href=\"mailto:info@lab-nyc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">info@lab-nyc.com</a>.&nbsp;</em></h4>', 'membermonday-sky-mejias.png', 1, '2018-10-07 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

They&rsquo;ve had to adjust their older songs to account for how their voice has deepened, and changing their name has meant having to work hard to keep old fans aware that they&rsquo;re still active on the indie scene. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of their music feels almost universally relatable: Themes of lost love, anxiety and starting over mingle with songs about accepting yourself and living your truth to paint a complex portrait of the artist who wrote them. A.W. certainly doesn&rsquo;t shy away from writing about queerness; it just feels like a common thread woven throughout their body of work rather than the main focus. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about gay stuff in that it&rsquo;s about human stuff,&rdquo; they said about &ldquo;The Same,&rdquo; from their 2015 album </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Love. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The song is one of those universally relatable ones that has complex layers; most of us have felt lonely and sad at some point in our lives, but as A.W. tells their story of finding their truth and starting to transition, the words take on new meaning: </span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Does anybody wonder how it ever got this bad?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Does anybody wish that they could change the way they are?</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">...</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"We all got feelings that we can\'t explain</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"We\'re all a little bit the same.&rdquo;</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"Indie singer A.W. shines at living room concert (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/44243097_2295228283834958_6606981056526548992_n.jpg\" alt=\"Indie singer A.W. shines at living room concert (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/5UYzEUYfzFL4lzleHOXGjp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">A.W.&rsquo;s sound</a> typically leans more toward indie pop, but for the living room show -- part of the Alone Not Lonely U.S. tour -- they went for a more mellow vibe.

I also came to New York last year to live in Outpost. The first time I came to New York it was for like two weeks to do some dance training. Vanessa Martinez De Ba&ntilde;os and Ashley Carter with DoubleTake Dance have known me since I was 18 and have seen me grow up as a dancer, and they invited me to come. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m back again this year. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be back next year, but I hope I can come soon.</p>\r\n<p>Aside from dancing, I like to draw and go to movies. I like the designer world -- making clothes. I studied that for two years and I&rsquo;d like to keep doing that along with dancing.</p>\r\n<h3>How did you get into dance? Why do you love dancing?</h3>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been dancing almost my whole life. At 9 I started doing rhythmic gymnastics, and then I changed to ballet at 15 because I was seeing that my career as a gymnast was ending and I wanted to keep being involved in that art. The most inspiring thing for me was ballet dance. From ballet I started going to new classes: contemporary, jazz and hip-hop.</p>\r\n<p>I love dance because think it&rsquo;s my way of living. I just feel free when I&rsquo;m moving. It&rsquo;s a way to express the things that I cannot speak.</p>\r\n<h3>Tell us about your performance this week</h3>\r\n<p>When I came here this performance was already planned, but we also did the StylePointe show in September with the company I&rsquo;m working with. This piece is called &ldquo;passage and perceptions.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve been rehearsing for weeks.</p>\r\n<p>For me it&rsquo;s a new piece, but they&rsquo;ve already done it before. I really like the view it gives of the timing of our lives. This will be performed in Dixon Place at 7:30 p.m. It&rsquo;s Oct. 16.</p>\r\n<h3>What\'s your favorite Outpost memory? What will you miss when you\'re gone?</h3>\r\n<p>KNICKERBOCKER. It&rsquo;s my family here. We had something special between us and we created a friendship that is not so common. The moments when we were at home and watching TV on the couch all together or going out to Carmelo&rsquo;s, I will never forget.</p>\r\n<h6><em>Photos: Lauren Vega</em></h6>', 'membermonday-garazi-prieto.JPG', 1, '2018-10-15 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

The house leader at every house should be the one to keep the mail keys.

The final straw was the construction of the 38-story Equitable Building, a behemoth that blocked sunlight from reaching the surrounding area:</p>\r\n<p class=\"img\"><img title=\"Why do so many NYC buildings remind us of giant wedding cakes? (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/the-equitable-building.jpg\" alt=\"Why do so many NYC buildings remind us of giant wedding cakes? (Image-2)\" /></p>\r\n<p><em>The Equitable Building</em></p>\r\n<p>The Equitable Building proved to be so controversial upon completion in 2015 that the City responded by passing the 1916 Zoning Resolution, the first citywide zoning ordinance in the U.S. The Zoning Resolution required all new buildings of a certain height to get narrower as they got taller, ensuring that our crowded sidewalks wouldn&rsquo;t live in darkness around the clock. In 1961, the resolution was updated to allow developers to build higher without setbacks as long as they provided adjacent space that was open to the public. So next time you take a break in a pocket park in Manhattan, you can thank the Zoning Resolution of 1961.</p>\r\n<p class=\"img\"><img title=\"Why do so many NYC buildings remind us of giant wedding cakes?

You can see the impact of the 1916 Zoning Resolution throughout.</em></p>\r\n<p>The setbacks can be found all over the city and internationally, but are especially noticeable on some of Manhattan&rsquo;s most well-known buildings, including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, the New Yorker hotel, the American Radiator Building and many more.

Here are some tips for making it fun for everyone. ', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Break out your stretchy pants and get ready for a Friendsgiving to remember. Here are some tips for making it fun for everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was never a big fan of Thanksgiving growing up, but Friendsgiving has developed into one of my favorite holiday traditions as an adult. The beautiful thing about celebrating Thanksgiving with friends is that you can do it however you&rsquo;d like; no tradition is too holy to exclude, no practice too silly to include. What&rsquo;s important is just being around people who mean something to you. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friendsgiving holds even more potential this year, as so many people at Outpost Club have never taken part in a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner. So break out your stretchy pants and get ready for a Friendsgiving to remember, keeping the following in mind:</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>The more, the merrier -- but be considerate</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s in the name: Friendsgiving is for friends. Be courteous of your other housemates, though, and ask permission before you invite anyone else -- unless you all have a prior understanding that the dinner is open-invitation.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Keep dietary needs in mind</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you&rsquo;re bringing a side dish or hosting the main event, don&rsquo;t forget to consider the dietary needs of your dinner guests. Vegetarianism and veganism are common enough today that most dinners will need to include separate dishes, and it never hurts to ask about food allergies, either. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every dish has to fit in with the dietary specifications of the pickier guests, but people will be grateful for options. If you&rsquo;re a guest, ask your host if there are any dietary needs you should be aware of. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"How to Pull Off a Great Friendsgiving (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/pumpkin%20pie.jpg\" alt=\"How to Pull Off a Great Friendsgiving (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Set up stations</h3>\r\n<p>Some of the same pitfalls of Thanksgiving apply to dinner with friends: The more people you have, the more likely it is that you won&rsquo;t be able to handle everything at once in a single kitchen.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where stations come in: Recruit volunteers to put together sides and salads outside of the main kitchen. If you live at Outpost Club, you&rsquo;re lucky; <a href=\"../our-houses\">most of our houses</a> have more than one kitchen in which you can spread out and prepare your meal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Introduce your own traditions</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have a specialty dish your family begs for? Are you a whiz at making a beautiful ratatouille, or did you grow up making tamales with your family before every holiday? One of the great things about Friendsgiving is that you aren&rsquo;t stuck with the traditions of a single family, so don&rsquo;t feel limited to the traditional American Thanksgiving sides like stuffing and mashed potatoes if you&rsquo;re trying to decide what kind of dish to bring to dinner. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversely, if you&rsquo;ve never celebrated an American Thanksgiving, you may want to experience some for the first time: set out that morning to watch the Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, go around the table to share something you&rsquo;re thankful for or make a wish as you pull the wishbone with a friend.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Enjoy the celebration</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where the food came from or who cooked it; quality time is the real point of Friendsgiving. So grab a drink, pull up a chair and get ready to have some fun, because nothing is more Thanksgiving than sharing a meal with family, whether it&rsquo;s the one you&rsquo;re born into or the one you&rsquo;ve chosen for yourself. </span></p>', 'thanksgiving dinner-min.jpg', 1, '2018-11-14 06:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 0);

Your best bet for a mostly unobstructed view is the west side of Central Park West in the 60s or 70s, as the east side isn&rsquo;t open to spectators.</p>\r\n<p>If you arrive late or don&rsquo;t mind missing some of the floats to have a more relaxing experience, you can always try walking through Central Park starting north of 86th Street; head south and you&rsquo;ll find a few hills that offer a good vantage point of the balloons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Arrive early</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The parade may not start until 9 a.m. on Nov. 22, but you&rsquo;ll want to make the trek from Brooklyn early if you want a shot at a good view; about 3.5 million people turn up every year to view the spectacle. Try to be in place by 6:30 a.m. for the best spots. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Be prepared</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It won&rsquo;t be much warmer than freezing by the time the parade starts -- and you&rsquo;ll be standing around for at least an hour before it even begins. Wear layers, bring a hat and gloves and don&rsquo;t forget a thermos of coffee or hot cocoa to help keep you warm until the fun starts. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t rely on the subway if you don&rsquo;t have to</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know how unreliable the New York City subway system can be. If you&rsquo;re running short on time, consider taking a Lyft once you&rsquo;re in Manhattan, or walking if you encounter delays in Midtown. There&rsquo;s no reason your fate has to rest in the hands of the MTA on an already busy day. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br /><em>Photo credit: Frank Camp/Creative Commons</em><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>', '3596400831_fd8126e69e_b-min.jpg', 1, '2018-11-16 06:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 0),

I spent my entire life there until I decided to move to Savannah, GA a year ago to pursue my education in Luxury Fashion Management. In my spare time, I love to write for publications on issues in the fashion industry, or I spend a lot of time on social media researching engagement analytics (I&rsquo;m such a nerd lol). The social media aspect ties into my passion for photography as well, where I spend most of my time in film, developing by hand.</p>\r\n<p>I ended up in New York by chance actually! I&rsquo;m here fulfilling an internship position with RKPR, managing sample pulls with fashion publications/celebrity clientele, and creating organic following engagement with social media influencers to better our client&rsquo;s brand. I&rsquo;m August I received an offer from my boss with 2 weeks to move to New York, so I took the opportunity and here I am! Haha.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>What&rsquo;s your favorite Outpost memory?</h3>\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly have a favorite because I have so many. I chose Outpost because I wanted a sense of community in a city where I knew nobody. However, some of my favorite memories have definitely been watching my friend group experience different cultures in a welcoming environment, or sitting around at the table together listening to Lindsey sing with their guitar. It&rsquo;s a real sense of family here.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Do you have a favorite place in Brooklyn?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m definitely basic when I say I love Dumbo (lol).&nbsp;That area in particular reminds me a lot of Cincinnati, so it&rsquo;s a little feeling of home now that I don&rsquo;t get to visit often. There&rsquo;s still so much of Brooklyn I haven&rsquo;t discovered yet, so if anyone has any recommendations, I want them!</p>\r\n<h3><br /><br />What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Although I came to New York for a job in fashion PR, I&rsquo;ve been working on a few projects here and there. I recently was signed to an agency in Manhattan, and now I&rsquo;ve been working on television shows, commercials, and campaigns! Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t talk about most of them (damn NDA&rsquo;s), but I will say to watch next season of Billions on Showtime.&nbsp;Otherwise, I really work a lot with brand influencing on my Instagram, and be sure to look out for the launch of my IGTV channel come January!</p>\r\n<p><em>Follow Jake on Instagram:&nbsp;</em>@<em>gldnnboy</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Photo: @thequarterrican</em></p>', '579D62C6-6606-4D2A-A7F6-D50BAF39F6D4.jpeg', 1, '2018-11-16 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

I post most of my work on Instagram (I&rsquo;m @nukanchik -- it means &ldquo;our people&rdquo; in Quechua). I do have a website, but I find it useless nowadays since everyone is using social media sites to represent brands.</p>\r\n<p>I was born here in Brooklyn but raised in Ecuador until I was 13. I lived for 3 years in Texas and when I was 16 I came to New York for vacation and ended up staying. I found so much culture that I could relate to and I didn&rsquo;t feel like an outsider anymore. I love taking photos, making movies, writing, biking, drinking coffee and eating sushi.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>What&rsquo;s your favorite Outpost Club memory?</h3>\r\n<p>I would say my favorite Outpost Club memory would be the <strong>Halloween party </strong>that was held in our house this year; everyone from different houses came through and we were all having fun.</p>\r\n<p>P.S., I love everything about the Outpost Club. It&rsquo;s a dream house.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>What&rsquo;s your favorite thing about Brooklyn?</h3>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of Greenpoint. It&rsquo;s so chilled, laid back and colorful. There are some cool murals around and you can get the perfect view of the city -- and it&rsquo;s right next to McCarren Park.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>What are you working on right now?</h3>\r\n<p>I can&rsquo;t really say much, but the company that I&rsquo;m working with is The Soap Box. You can find them on Instagram: <strong>@tsbxco</strong>.

Burpees</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to personal trainer </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-work-out-at-home-in-case-coronavirus-quarantine-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bryan Goldberg</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, burpees (also known as squat thrusts) are the most effective form of at-home exercise in a confined space. A burpee is a full body exercise, beginning in a standing position, moving into a squat with your hands on the ground, then kicking your feet back into a plank position and immediately returning to a squat position before standing up. You can find full instructions and a visual guide </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU8QYVW0gDU\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Always remember to go at your own pace, so why not start with 5 or 10 at a time and build up the amount of burpees you complete in a day gradually? Just make sure any fury friends are out the way first!</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Squats</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Squats are one of the most accessible forms of at-home exercise. They&rsquo;re also one of the best ways of burning fat and building muscle that you can do without the help of a personal trainer (or even a mirror). Try the </span><a href=\"https://www.coachmag.co.uk/exercises/full-body-workouts/1655/30-day-squat-challenge\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 day squat challenge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to build up your fitness in a controlled, effective way. The best part of this challenge is the structure it will give your life in quarantine. Watch the next 30 days pass you by with a tighter, more agile physique as your reward.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong><strong>3. Skipping</strong></strong>&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why not add some childhood nostalgia into your workout routine? Skipping is both fun and good exercise, making it the perfect way to lift your spirits in quarantine. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.brsa.org.uk/skipping-rope-as-sports-training/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">British Skipping Rope Association</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, skipping is a great full body workout; it can help boost your immune system, improve your overall health and just one hour of the activity can burn 1,600 calories.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Stair training</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you&rsquo;re isolating in a house with stairs or an apartment block with probably even more stairs, stairs are the one piece of exercise equiptment most people have available to them. Stair training is also a surprisingly great form of exercise and the perfect way to feel as though you&rsquo;re moving in these otherwise static times. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://www.runsociety.com/training/stair-climbing-vs-running/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Run Society</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the benefits of stair climbing are huge, with the vertical movement in particular making for an effective workout, as your leg muscles are forced to resist gravity to lift your body while the rest of your body must stabilize and balance. Stair climbing is ideal for training your calves, hamstrings, glutes and quads, toning your lower body and boosting your stamina. Try walking or running up and down your most accessible stairs for 15-20 minutes, gradually building your workout up to 30 minutes. Just be&nbsp;sure to practice social distancing if you encounter other people from outside your household.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Jumping jacks</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jumping jacks are fun and, let&rsquo;s face it, we all know how to do them. This activity is also incredibly versatile as you can do as many as you feel comfortable doing in your workout. According to </span><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/jumping-jacks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthline</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, jumping jacks work your heart, lungs and muscles at the same time by combining aerobic exercise and resistance work and are specifically good for working your glutes, quadriceps and hip flexors. They&rsquo;re great for both movement and agility and the ideal activity to do while listening to your favorite 80s songs on repeat. So why not get your leg warmers on and start jumping?</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', '2_12.jpg', 1, '2020-04-12 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Being in architecture school has allowed to study and work abroad in some amazing places. Last year I had the opportunity to study and travel through Europe with some of my classmates. We visited 12 different countries in 4 months. Now I&rsquo;m currently doing a 6-month internship for an architecture firm in Lower Manhattan. I&rsquo;ll be wrapping up the internship in a few weeks and heading back to Austin to finish my last semester. I have no clue where life will take me after that!</p>\r\n<p>In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, going to concerts, watching movies, drawing and taking photos. New friends say I&rsquo;m easy-going. Old friends tell me I need to work on my texting. Roommates would say I need to go out more. Co-workers say I&rsquo;m always snacking. Mom says I never call.</p>\r\n<h3>What&rsquo;s your favorite Outpost memory?</h3>\r\n<p>The Knickerbocker House! I met some of the coolest people there. Will always remember the countless nights we either stayed in and watched movies or went out as a group to our local bar. These are the types of nights that turn roommates into family.</p>\r\n<h3>Do you have a favorite place in Brooklyn?</h3>\r\n<p>I really enjoy walking around Williamsburg. Gives me hipster Austin, Texas, vibes that make me feel at home in a different city. The architect in me loves that area because of Domino Park &hellip; such a nicely designed park with a great view of Manhattan. 12/10 would recommend.</p>\r\n<h3>What are you currently working on?</h3>\r\n<p>At the office I&rsquo;m currently working on a few things: a renovation of an apartment building on the Upper East Side, a pavilion in Miami and a synagogue in upstate NY. Other tasks done at work include: trying to look busy, buying plane tickets, thinking of clever Instagram captions (<strong>@franco.cean)</strong>, writing this Member Monday and calling my mom.</p>', 'Screen Shot 2018-12-03 at 12.41.33 PM.png', 1, '2018-12-03 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Outpost Club members gain an instant community with opportunities to socialize, network and grow, all in beautiful and convenient houses at affordable prices.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"5 Outpost Club Expands to Manhattan (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/350manhattan_large-5.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Club Expands to Manhattan (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"5 Outpost Club Expands to Manhattan (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/350manhattan_large-10.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Club Expands to Manhattan (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"5 Outpost Club Expands to Manhattan (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/350manhattan_large-13.jpg\" alt=\"Outpost Club Expands to Manhattan (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>', '350manhattan_large-5.jpg', 1, '2018-12-04 06:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 0),

On each floor you have all you need and if something is being used by somebody else you can take that from the other floors: all is for everybody in the building. Each floor has a loundry machine, a dryer and a dishwasher. Also, they organize events to stay altogether.

We all have to put work into keeping the atmosphere in our houses positive and respectful, but sometimes that balance gets thrown off when someone isn&rsquo;t pulling their weight. Here\'s what you should do when that happens.</p>', '<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Outpost, your house leader is someone you&rsquo;re going to want to get to know very well. They&rsquo;re your main connection to the company and will be there for you if you have questions about Outpost or if you need help with anything. Our house leaders are vital to Outpost and their wells of knowledge run deep. As part of our Ask a House Leader series, here&rsquo;s an answer to one recent question for them:</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Q: What should I do if my roommate isn&rsquo;t pulling their weight?</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A: Living with other people is a series of compromises and getting used to everyone&rsquo;s unique habits and needs. We all have to put work into keeping the atmosphere in our houses positive and respectful, but sometimes that balance gets thrown off when someone isn&rsquo;t pulling their weight. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe your roommate takes hour-long showers in the morning when everyone is trying to get ready, or uses more than their share of the fridge. More than likely, they&rsquo;re not doing it on purpose and probably haven&rsquo;t noticed anything is wrong. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important not to react to this kind of situation with passive-aggression; if someone doesn&rsquo;t realize what they&rsquo;re doing, they won&rsquo;t notice sarcastic remarks or sideways glances. Instead, it&rsquo;s important to diffuse the situation in a straightforward, polite manner. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk to the person privately and explain what you&rsquo;d like addressed. Try not to sound accusatory -- merely tell them what&rsquo;s been bothering you and how you&rsquo;d like it addressed. Speaking in person is so much more effective than group messages or even individual texts. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vast majority of the time, just talking to someone will fix the issue. In those rare cases where it&rsquo;s not enough, though, that&rsquo;s where your house leader comes in! Never hesitate to bring something like this up to your house leader; we&rsquo;ll either deal with it ourselves, or, where necessary, escalate accordingly. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some basic guidelines to follow to make sure your house is a positive place for everyone who lives there: </span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Always take out the trash, wipe down the kitchen counters and make sure the dishwasher is loaded and unloaded on your cleaning day.</li>\r\n<li>Keep in mind that people may be sleeping when you get home late or leave early, and respect quiet hours.</li>\r\n<li>Be respectful of your roommates&rsquo; time in the morning; no one wants to be late to work because their roommate was locked in the bathroom all morning.</li>\r\n<li>Respect the fridge and cabinet space of the rest of the house.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With those guidelines in mind, you&rsquo;ll rarely run into a situation where a house leader needs to step in, but we&rsquo;re always around if you need us!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sadly, there are times when it is impossible to speak the same language as your partner.

And that&rsquo;s not even including paying above-average drink prices. Why go through the trouble when you can have the same amount of fun for the cost of your drinks at Outpost&rsquo;s party?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Your friends are coming</h2>\r\n<p>Need we say more?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>It&rsquo;s going to be a blast</h2>\r\n<p>Neon, check. Light show, check. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&lsquo;90s outfits? That&rsquo;s on you.&nbsp;</span>Snack, drink and dance your heart out to everyone&rsquo;s favorite &lsquo;90s bands, visit the &lsquo;90s-themed photo booth and let out your competitive side on the Twister mat -- or toss around a Koosh ball, walk a Slinky down the stairs and plan a sticky-hand attack on your friends.

The inviting indoor cafe is perfect for sampling the variety of traditional and more innovative baked goods Rudy&rsquo;s offers, including s&rsquo;mores cookies and Nutella tarts. Bonus: You can even have a variety of fresh cannoli filled for you on the spot. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">905 Seneca Ave. </span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"These Are Some of Our Favorite Ridgewood Bakeries (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/39AD7495-F0CD-47EB-A243-78D4BF26A003.JPG\" alt=\"These Are Some of Our Favorite Ridgewood Bakeries (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>El Monta&ntilde;ero</h3>\r\n<p>El Monta&ntilde;ero isn&rsquo;t strictly a bakery, and its Colombian lunch and dinner fare certainly deserves some attention, too. But it&rsquo;s El Monta&ntilde;ero&rsquo;s phenomenal Colombian pastries and desserts that planted the restaurant firmly on this list.

Nearby residents swear you can smell the freshly baked bread every morning from blocks away, and the wide variety of pastries (thanks to Grimaldi&rsquo;s being a supplier for some local grocery stores) makes it worth the walk from the Forest or Seneca Ave. M stops. </span></p>\r\n<p><em>2101 Menehan St.</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"These Are Some of Our Favorite Ridgewood Bakeries (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/8E9CC6F1-9E85-4FAF-A582-A4CE2A90F8A3.JPG\" alt=\"These Are Some of Our Favorite Ridgewood Bakeries (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Polska Piekarnia</h3>\r\n<p>Stepping into this narrow shop is like stepping through a portal right into Poland, where the cozy bakery manages to offer everything from tarts and danishes to traditional Polish burek and pierogi. There&rsquo;s also a solid stock of packaged Polish foods and other goods. Polska Piekarnia, which used to be called the Old World Bakery, is just across the intersection from the Forest Ave. M stop.</p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6691 Forest Ave.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"These Are Some of Our Favorite Ridgewood Bakeries (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/0A096BDA-3DBD-4504-9BC0-8B4D4EE96991.JPG\" alt=\"These Are Some of Our Favorite Ridgewood Bakeries (Image-4)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Gwendolyn&rsquo;s Corner Shop</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gwendolyn&rsquo;s Corner Shop is almost too adorable to feel real, with saccharine pink walls and white accents that make you feel like you&rsquo;re in a dollhouse. The baked goods from this shop near the Forest Ave. M stop are no joke, though; the large variety of offerings, custom pies and freshly baked bread are sure to keep you coming back for more. </span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">818 Woodward Ave.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"These Are Some of Our Favorite Ridgewood Bakeries (Image-5), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/1E99C05F-13D9-4339-99C2-BF02604917A1.JPG\" alt=\"These Are Some of Our Favorite Ridgewood Bakeries (Image-5)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Bonus: Joel&rsquo;s Bakery</h3>\r\n<p>I probably walked right past Joel&rsquo;s Bakery, off the Myrtle-Wyckoff stop -- and technically about 20 steps outside of Ridgewood (in Bushwick) -- dozens of times before noticing it, but I&rsquo;m glad I finally did. The tiny storefront opens into a Mexican-Caribbean bakery with stacks of fresh bread and loads of tasty treats. They also do full-scale custom cakes for special occasions. You can basically stumble into Joel&rsquo;s as you get off the train at Myrtle-Wyckoff, so there&rsquo;s no reason not to take a peek inside.</p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1615 Palmetto St., Bushwick, Brooklyn</span></em></p>', 'BD617C05-400B-4E7C-9134-2615A8F77FA0.JPG', 1, '2019-01-04 06:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 0),

And then one day you&rsquo;ll give someone directions to the train and not even blink when a rat runs across your path, and you&rsquo;ll suddenly realize that you&rsquo;re exactly where you belong. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until you get there, though, there are plenty of things to know that will make your time in <a href=\"../nyc-rooms-for-rent\" target=\"_blank\">New York</a> easier. Here are a few: </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>The subway system is an untamable beast</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York&rsquo;s subway system is the most expansive in the world and runs 24/7. That means you can easily get away with not setting foot behind the wheel of a car when you live here -- but it also means it&rsquo;s kind of a mess, and delays and service changes happen all the time. Just because you can take the M into the city from Brooklyn during rush hour doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll be able to catch it at the same time late at night or on the weekend, so it&rsquo;s important to double-check service alerts before you go out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, apps like Citymapper will quickly become essential, and the $2.75 per trip won&rsquo;t seem like too big a deal once you realize that taking a taxi or Lyft is rarely faster than taking a train, but way more expensive. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Carry cash even if you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll need it</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash is still king in many places in New York City, including at some of the family businesses that will soon become your favorites. You also never know when you&rsquo;re going to need to load your Metrocard only to find that both the machines at your station are temporarily cash only. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Learn the unspoken rules of the city</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of us follow an unspoken social code that helps us survive in a city of 8.6 million. Here are a few to start you off:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&rsquo;t lean against subway poles, ever, and never take up more than one seat.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand on the right and walk on the left on escalators, but walk on the right on stairs. </span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have to stop walking to look at your phone or orient yourself, </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don&rsquo;t do it in the middle of the sidewalk. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step to the side. </span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let everyone off the subway car you&rsquo;re trying to enter before you board. </span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always have your debit card, cash or Metrocard out </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">before </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you need to use it so you don&rsquo;t hold up the line at the bodega, turnstile, etc. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>You can have fun without spending a fortune</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some things about living in New York are expensive, but there&rsquo;s plenty to do in the city that won&rsquo;t break the bank. There are </span><a href=\"https://www.nyc-arts.org/collections/35/free-museum-days-or-pay-what-you-wish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tons of museums</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that are free, take donations or have weekly or monthly free days, for instance, and public parks like Central, Prospect and Brooklyn Bridge parks are always worth a visit. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even wandering around in new neighborhoods is a treat, from Chinatown to <a href=\"../blog/the-appeal-of-living-in-bushwick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bushwick</a> to Astoria; there&rsquo;s something for everyone just a train ride away.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>You&rsquo;re going to want to invest in a good umbrella</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It rains more often in New York than many people realize, and with every storm come piles of $3 umbrellas abandoned on the street corners because a slight breeze flipped them inside out, rendering them useless. And once it&rsquo;s raining, that $3 umbrella is going to cost you $15, so the first time your umbrella breaks mid-storm and you show up to an event looking like a cat that got dropped into a bathtub, you&rsquo;ll realize it&rsquo;s worth it to spend a bit more on an umbrella that will last. Just make sure it&rsquo;s not gigantic. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>We&rsquo;re not trying to be rude</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We aren&rsquo;t trying to make you feel bad when we don&rsquo;t smile at you as we rush past. We&rsquo;re just in a hurry, and there are so many people in New York that if you don&rsquo;t rush to get somewhere, you aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. Don&rsquo;t expect anyone to make small talk on the subway, either: We have very little personal space and sometimes our mental space is all we have to call our own. You&rsquo;ll soon learn to value it as much as we do. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, all of that goes out the window if you ask us for directions. There&rsquo;s nothing we love more than showing off our knowledge of New York&rsquo;s public transportation system (as long as you&rsquo;re quick about it).</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>You&rsquo;re going to miss out on stuff, and that&rsquo;s OK </strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&rsquo;s a lot going on in New York. Between work functions, parties and other invitations, you&rsquo;ll soon realize that you&rsquo;re being pulled in a million directions every day -- and there&rsquo;s literally not time for it all. At first it will be difficult to say no when someone invites you to free drinks or a gallery opening, but you&rsquo;ll eventually realize that as much as you want to explore every inch of your new home, it&rsquo;s just as important to take time for yourself. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>That said, you should take advantage of living in the greatest city in the world</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being in New York is an experience like no other. Get out there are live it.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"8 Things Everyone Moving to New York Should Know (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/dean-rose-602672-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"8 Things Everyone Moving to New York Should Know (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /> </span></p>', 'aaron-burson-242126-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2019-01-11 06:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 0),

Read on to see how he&rsquo;s hoping to impact the world of coliving. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tell us a bit about yourself.</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&rsquo;m an unabashed foodie who leaps at the chance to try out Brooklyn&rsquo;s delicious cuisines. I work at a tech startup in Manhattan without knowing how to write a single line of code -- but I have a knack for developing businesses, so that&rsquo;s what I focus on. I&rsquo;m also the founder of YellowKamp, which connects awesome people (yes, like you!) with awesome spaces. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems like I&rsquo;ve been living in NYC forever, although I&rsquo;ve only been here for around five months now! I moved here from sunny Orlando, Fla., to enjoy the big-city life that New York offers. I have not been disappointed -- not yet, at least -- as it&rsquo;s been a lot of fun and I think I&rsquo;ve grown a lot personally.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&rsquo;s your favorite thing about Outpost Club?</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My favorite thing about Outpost is the people who live in these houses; I&rsquo;ve met so many interesting people from all over. Everyone seems to get along and everyone is quite friendly. This was really important to me when I first moved here not knowing many people -- I wanted to meet people who I could make friends with and who would allow me to expand my worldview. I&rsquo;ve definitely found that. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people like me, it&rsquo;s nice to know that you don&rsquo;t have to explore your new city alone. I&rsquo;ve had some of the best times hanging out with roommates and have even picked up a few new hobbies, like painting and improv.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have a favorite place in Brooklyn? Where do you want to explore more?</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I adore Prospect Park and would probably choose that as my favorite place in Brooklyn, but I have a few go-to spots that are on my list of favs. Dos Toros, Roberta&rsquo;s, and Sweet Chick are great for food. Barcade and Union Pool are fun places to drink. I also like to catch the midnight showings at Nighthawk Cinema when I can. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I&rsquo;ve done a fair amount of exploring, there&rsquo;s still so much more for me to see. I&rsquo;d like to check out some of the museums and art galleries around town, and when the weather warms up a bit, I&rsquo;d like to check out some of the nearby beaches, as well.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are you working on right now?</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&rsquo;m building </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YellowKamp.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It&rsquo;s basically a site where people can find coliving spaces. I stumbled across coliving when I was searching for a place to stay in New York and it seemed like a cool concept, and it also made things super convenient for my move. I decided that I would give it a try, but wanted to be certain that I chose the right place. I looked around, and eventually found </span><a href=\"../\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outpost Club</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I remember most was how much of a headache it was to find these. At the time there wasn&rsquo;t an easy way to find places that provided options for coliving specifically, so I built one. Now YellowKamp has info for all the coliving offered in eight cities across the globe (with more to come)! </span></p>', 'Screen Shot 2019-01-21 at 11.24.22 AM.png', 1, '2019-01-21 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

It&rsquo;s also a park with a lot to offer, with dozens of fountains, monuments and statues that have been added over time since construction began in 1858, and myriad events and activities for the more than 40 million people who visit every year. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those 40 million people make Central Park the most popular urban park in the world and one of the most-visited tourist attractions in the world, by the way. Here are five other interesting things you may not know about America&rsquo;s favorite park (besides that it\'s only a few minutes\' walk from our <a href=\"../central-park-manhattan-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Central Park Manhattan House</a>!):</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"5 things you didn&rsquo;t know about Central Park (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/juan-di-nella-473902-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"5 things you didn&rsquo;t know about Central Park (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manhattan bedrock wasn&rsquo;t messing around</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large chunk of Manhattan was built on a layer of bedrock that&rsquo;s very close to the surface,, which is what makes our skyscrapers possible (and why we don&rsquo;t have fossils). The Manhattan Schist, the layer of bedrock under Central Park, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">took so much effort to blast through</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that more gunpowder was used to clear the land for the park than was used in the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s appeared in more movies than any other single location &hellip;</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">...at least in the past two decades. According to a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dec. 2017 analysis</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of movies listed on IMDb, Central Park is present in 231 on-location shots, more than any other location aside from actual film studios.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was the first landscaped public park in the United States</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The kinds of public parks we&rsquo;re used to today, with elaborately planned walkways, statues, fountains and green areas, were still a relatively new concept in the U.S. in the 1850s, </span><a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/park-history.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when Central Park was conceived</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But as Manhattan became more crowded than ever, it became obvious that people needed a place to escape the hustle and bustle of city life that wasn&rsquo;t a cemetery. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result, an 843-acre Central Park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, has been held up as a standard for the world and used as a model for parks like the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, Ueno Park in Tokyo and Stanley Park in Vancouver.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"5 things you didn&rsquo;t know about Central Park (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/juan-di-nella-473905-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"5 things you didn&rsquo;t know about Central Park (Image-2)\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 36 bridges and arches in the park -- and no two are alike</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olmsted and Vaux</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Central Park&rsquo;s designers, believed that if bridges and arches had to be present in their park -- which they did to support roads and other necessary structures -- they should have been as unobtrusive as possible, noticeable only when someone walked right up to them, and even then blending with their surroundings. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result of this attitude was 36 artful bridges and arches dotting the park, made of a variety of materials and in a plethora of styles, all meant to complement the specific area in which they were built: nothing more, nothing less. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Central Park cost more than all of Alaska</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just purchasing the park&rsquo;s 843 acres </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">et the New York legislature back $7.4 million</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, less than the $7.2 million the U.S. paid Russia for the entire state of Alaska a decade later.

Practicing self-care looks different for everyone (as it should), but at its heart it means you&rsquo;re taking action to protect your own health and happiness. Here are some tips to get you started: </span></p>\r\n<h2>Stick to a routine</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s tempting to stay in bed for as long as possible to avoid the cold and darkness of the early morning -- or to go to bed earlier and earlier because night comes so early and it&rsquo;s miserable outside -- but you really won&rsquo;t be doing yourself any favors. For some people, winter means feeling lethargic and unmotivated, so doing small things like waking up at the same time every morning or listening to a favorite podcast every day on the way home from work can help restore some normalcy to what can be a bleak time of year. </span></p>\r\n<h2>But don&rsquo;t be afraid to switch things up</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">February may be the shortest month, but it can feel never-ending when it&rsquo;s cold out. You don&rsquo;t have to make major changes if you feel like you&rsquo;re stuck in a rut, but switching things up can be an act of self-care; cooking new recipes, trying a hobby you normally wouldn&rsquo;t or even changing your hairstyle can all help you shake the blues. </span></p>\r\n<h2>Get moving</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the immortal words of Elle Woods, &ldquo;Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy.&rdquo; Stress and anxiety can make wintertime blues feel even worse, and exercise is a known reliever of both. </span></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Mayo Clinic</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> notes that getting outdoors within a couple of hours of waking up is especially helpful, so adding a morning walk or jog to your daily routine might be just what the doctor ordered. </span></p>\r\n<h2>Give yourself a break</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self care is both a physical and a mental act of self-preservation and love, and sometimes what you need most is just to give both your body and your mind a time-out, especially during winter when our immune systems are </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working in overdrive</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to keep us healthy. So grab a book, make some tea, turn on The Great British Baking Show, and get recharging: It&rsquo;s the least you can do. </span></p>', 'matthew-henry-58760-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2019-02-01 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

New Yorkers are open, friendly people when you&rsquo;re not blocking their way on the sidewalk and they&rsquo;ll jump at the opportunity to explain their city and make recommendations to newcomers. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of our favorites are </span><strong>Bootleg Bar</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Braven Brewing Company</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Bushwick, </span><strong>Burly Coffee</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Bed-Stuy and </span><strong>Ange Noir Cafe</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in East Williamsburg.</span></p>\r\n<h2>Take advantage of tech</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apps for meeting friends have recently become trendy, including </span><strong>Bumble BFF</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the networking app </span><strong>Shapr</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>.</strong> Swipe right or left to find the perfect person and if you match, you can meet in real life.

By far the easiest way to meet people is coliving, because your new friends won&rsquo;t forget to call you back or give you a fake name (you know where they live, after all). </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coliving throws together groups of <a href=\"../blog_category/membermonday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">like-minded people</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;and, at least at Outpost, helps you break the ice with a series of fun events, including </span><a href=\"../blog/outpost-club-welcomes-autumn-on-the-water\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trips</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"../blog/outpost-club-rings-in-the-new-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">parties</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"../blog/what-we-learned-at-outposts-blind-sculpting-party\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">workshops</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Christopher Hollowell (the \"Well\" in Dun-Well) called up his old college friend Dan Dunbar (the \"Dun\" in Dun-Well), looking for a quality vegan doughnut shop in NYC. To their amazement, they couldn&rsquo;t find anything that made the cut, so they decided to do it themselves &mdash; opening NYC\'s first all-vegan doughnut cafe.</p>\r\n<p>Dun-Well is a gem on Montrose Avenue. Step through the glass doors into a vintage interior with plenty of seating and natural light, and, of course, a large glass case filled with a variety of delicious doughnut flavors.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Destination: Dun-Well Doughnuts (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2345678.jpg\" alt=\"Destination: Dun-Well Doughnuts (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each doughnut is handcrafted daily, with a changing menu, which means you&rsquo;re always getting something special.

Our recent favorites have been The Homer, a signature pink sprinkles doughnut inspired by the Simpsons, the PB &amp; J and a delicious Blueberry French Toast. You can choose from regular, filled or cake doughnuts, starting from just $1.50 each or &frac12; dozen for $14.</span></p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a complete range of espresso and coffee drinks on offer, expertly prepared on a top-of-the-line La Marzoccos, and a selection of tea and other drinks, making it the perfect place to chill out with friends or work on your screenplay for an afternoon.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though Montrose Avenue is filled with trendy cafes and bakeries, Dun-Well has beaten the odds to become a successful business, with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a second store</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recently opened on the Lower East Side in Manhattan. This is a testament to the quality of their doughnuts, which you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell were vegan if we hadn&rsquo;t just told you.</span></p>\r\n<p>At the heart of Dun-Well&rsquo;s philosophy is ethics; they&rsquo;re committed to using only quality ingredients and supporting local businesses. All of their products are free of animal or animal-derived ingredients and both their coffee and doughnuts are made with organic ingredients.

I&rsquo;m Lotus and I just moved to NYC from Chicago 2 months ago for an advertising program. I come from the land of really good pizza, really cold winters, Obama and unique art installations. (You may have heard of The Bean; if not, check it out.) I&rsquo;m excited to see all of the interesting and innovative things New York City has to offer.</p>\r\n<h1>What\'s your favorite Outpost memory?</h1>\r\n<p>My favorite Outpost memory so far has been spending New Year\'s Eve here at the East Bushwick house. I had just moved to the city and we had a \'90s-themed celebration that night. Outpost members from different houses that I had never met before showed their lovely faces and we had fun together jamming out to \'90s tunes and watching the ball drop in Times Square. Afterwards, we went up to the rooftop and watched our neighbors pop fireworks in the rain. It was definitely a great introduction to the city and one of the best nights of my life. Can&rsquo;t wait until the Fourth of July!</p>\r\n<h1>What&rsquo;s your favorite part of New York?</h1>\r\n<p>New York is just a bigger, dirtier, more diverse version of Chicago! Actually, that&rsquo;s not true. Contrary to popular belief, NYC and Chicago are completely different places. The thing I like the most about New York so far, though, is how wacky and creative the city is. You really can find some of the most offbeat things here -- from the Troll Museum to the annual No Pants Subway Ride that happens in January; it really is a unique place where anything can happen! I also love the fashion. New Yorkers are very stylish!</p>\r\n<h1>What are you working on now?</h1>\r\n<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m working on building my copywriting portfolio as I&rsquo;m studying at Miami Ad School to become a copywriter. I&rsquo;m enjoying the process of generating new ideas and all that being a part of the creative side of advertising entails. If anyone wants to chat about advertising stuff, give me a holler!</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', 'A5FB5CDD-4A1E-490E-8D13-1D66C998EC39.JPG', 1, '2019-03-18 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

Either way, now is the time to try our new favorite Bed-Stuy spot.</span></p>\r\n<p>Guacuco is one of those places where you can find both authenticity and a welcoming atmosphere; somewhere that is just as vibrant in taste as it is in spirit. This Venezuelan restaurant, located just a 5-minute walk from our <a href=\"../the-bed-stuy-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bed-Stuy House</a> and a short walk from our South Williamsburg House, has a no-frills, minimalistic interior, filled with primary colors, exposed brickwork, plants and even a hammock on the wall. Step inside to colorful murals set against wooden chairs and a fully stocked bar in the corner.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Destination: Arepera Guacuco (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/Guacuco.jpg\" alt=\"Destination: Arepera Guacuco (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Arepera&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;a place that sells arepas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guacuco&rdquo; is the name of the Venezuelan beach where owner Leonardo Molina was born. This encapsulates the two sides of this restaurant and bar: its dedication to both family values and good food. Made from Carmen&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s secret recipe, the arepas at Arepera Guacuco are freshly made every day. In fact, the entire menu is full of fresh, authentic ingredients. Find a selection of Venezuelan salads, empanadas and traditional dishes, including asopado de mariscos, cachapa, carite frito and, of course, arepas.</p>\r\n<p>Our favorite is anything involving the shredded beef, which has a knack for melting in your mouth that we simply can&rsquo;t explain. We love their version of Venezuela&rsquo;s national dish, pabellon criollo (juicy shredded beef and sweet plantain, topped with aged cheese, rice, beans and a plain arepa on the side). Guacuco focuses on quality and all of their arepas and empanadas are made with 100% cornflour (using Harina P.A.N) and are gluten free and fresh to order. The wall art includes a mural of a Venezuelan beach and of a map of Bed-Stuy, capturing the unique fusion of cultures that Guacuco holds.</p>\r\n<p>Although the food is great, Arepera Guacuco has much more to offer than just a simple dinner spot. First of all, let&rsquo;s get back to that bar we mentioned. Their cocktails are delicious. Enjoy a sweet passion fruit mojito with fresh mint leaves, followed by a Venezuela libra. Or how about a coconut caipirinha, or a traditional pisco sour? If you arrive early, stop by for happy hour and stay for dinner for the perfect evening out.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"Destination: Arepera Guacuco (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/arepera-du-plateau-4.jpg\" alt=\"Destination: Arepera Guacuco (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guacuco even has its own venue, The Back Room, tucked behind the restaurant and bar with a regular schedule of live music and stand up comedy.

The neighborhood is famous for its authentic brownstone homes and you can find Anne and Romanesque Revival architecture juxtaposed against modern coffee shops and new builds, especially along Nostrand Avenue and Halsey Street.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why Bed-Study is a great place to live (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/bedford_stuyvesant_real_estate_2.jpg\" alt=\"Why Bed-Study is a great place to live (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bed-Stuy is rich in 18th-century Dutch history and Revolutionary War heritage, as well as black American civil rights history, with monuments like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restoration Plaza </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on Fulton Street. It is the site of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Our Lady</strong> of Victory</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a neo-Gothic, 19th-century Catholic church, at 583 Throop Ave. Check out the full list of the area&rsquo;s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">historic buildings</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> here.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>The art scene</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bed-Stuy is an artist&rsquo;s paradise, in part due to the emerging artists who have made the neighborhood their home in recent years. Just walking along the street will lead you to an array of murals, such as the </span><a href=\"https://donyc.com/p/biggie-smalls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biggie mural</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the corner of Bedford Ave. and Quincy St., and the artistic tribute to </span><strong>rapper OBD</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of the founding members of the </span><strong>Wu-Tang Clan</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, at 448 Franklin Ave.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explore emerging and established artists at the </span><strong>Richard Beavers Gallery</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>The Bishop Gallery</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there; art is woven into the very fabric of Bed-Stuy living. Local coffee shops like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mary&rsquo;s Coffee Shop</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, just a short walk from our Bed-Stuy House, are filled with local art hanging on the walls, and spaces like the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Living Gallery</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at 1094 Broadway hold regular art classes and live music performances, with a rotating display of art at your fingertips.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why Bed-Study is a great place to live (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/https---hypebeast.com-image-2017-05-notorious-big-mural-taken-down-tw.jpg\" alt=\"Why Bed-Study is a great place to live (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>The particularly eclectic mix of food, drink and culture</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bed-Stuy has significant Caribbean, Trinidadian and Haitian communities, which means there are a variety of authentic eateries on offer. Try </span><strong>Grandchamps</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, at 197 Patchen Ave., for amazing Haitian food, including bone-in stewed chicken, fried fish and griot. Get delicious French food at the </span><strong>Georges-Andres Vintage Cafe</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or grab an Eastern European coffee at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Zabka Eastern European Cafe</strong>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bed-Stuy is a true mix of old and new. Find historic community options peppered with modern coffee shops, restaurants, bars and, of course, affordable vintage stores. The crowning jewel of the latter is </span><strong>Harold and Maude Vintage</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with genuine vintage pieces at affordable prices. Another favorite, </span><strong>The Meat Market</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, at 380 Tompkins Ave., may look like a butcher shop outside, but inside you&rsquo;ll find a range of high quality, ethical picks. Bed-Stuy is also rich in artsy bars like </span><strong>C&rsquo;mon Everybody</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which hosts up-and-coming musicians and special events, including regular burlesque shows.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why Bed-Study is a great place to live (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/harold-and-maude2.jpg\" alt=\"Why Bed-Study is a great place to live (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>The green spaces</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green space is hard to come by in New York City. One of the best parts of Bed-Stuy is the unexpected abundance of parks and green spaces that this neighborhood holds. </span><strong>Herbert Von King Park</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>,</strong> one of Brooklyn&rsquo;s first parks, is a green oasis right in the middle of Bed-Stuy, designed by Frederick Law Olsted (of the same duo who designed Central Park and Prospect Park). Find fitness equipment, a baseball field and even the outdoor </span><strong>Eubie Blake Auditorium</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you can find free jazz concerts in the summer. Or in the south end of Bed-Stuy, find beautiful </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fulton Park</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a little slice of Washington Square Park brought east into Brooklyn, with chess tables and flowers galore. This community-feeling park is home to an annual </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">art fair </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the summer and a </span><strong>Halloween parade</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the fall.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bed-Stuy is also just a short walk from Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest and most famous park, </span><strong>Prospect Park</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This 526-acre has specially designated cycle tracks, &agrave; la Central Park, and even a zoo. Take a picnic lunch and whittle away a Sunday afternoon on the grass. Environmentalists will love the </span><strong>Magnolia Tree Earth Center</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Lafayette Ave., dedicated to urban beautification and community sustainability, as well as the large number of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community gardens</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scattered around the neighborhood.</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', 'https---hypebeast.com-image-2017-05-notorious-big-mural-taken-down-tw.jpg', 1, '2019-03-21 05:00:00', NULL, 0, 0, 0),

The Italian community thrives along the north end of Graham Avenue, known as &ldquo;Via Vespucci,&rdquo; while the south end of Graham Avenue (also known as &ldquo;Avenue of Puerto Rico&rdquo;) has been the center of Latin-American immigrant life since the 1950s. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 1990s, the area saw an influx of young artists, professionals and students, making the atmosphere a unique fusion of its two neighbors, Williamsburg and Bushwick. The area still maintains its historical industrial life, giving it a real personality of its own. Read on to find out why so many people want to live in East Williamsburg.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why East Williamsburg Is a Great Place to Live (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/benefits/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-10%20at%202.52.56%20PM.png\" alt=\"Why East Williamsburg Is a Great Place to Live (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<h1>The sense of discovery</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of East Williamsburg looks like factories&mdash;until you get closer&mdash;and this is all part of the fun. This neighborhood is filled with artistic and cultural gems, hidden away by the industrial aesthetic, which makes discovering them all the more rewarding. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hipster grocery stores and murals sit next to working factories producing everything from glass to beer. You&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking the sound of metal work and scraping steel meant Google Maps had taken you to the wrong location, but in East Williamsburg the industrial and the cultural co-exist. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&rsquo;ll find hidden-away DIY spaces, tech start-ups and trendy new shops in the most unexpected places, with that artistic vibe you dreamed of when you first decided to move to Brooklyn. For instance, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a continuous </span><strong>mural</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vandervoort</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Place </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stretches </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">almost the entire block between Thames Street and Flushing Avenue.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At </span><strong>56 Bogart</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, find a converted factory filled with artists&rsquo; studios and galleries, or explore </span><strong>The Loom</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a tucked away mini-mall filled with galleries, shops, a cafe, a tattoo parlor and a yoga studio. We love tropical beauty bar </span><strong>Wild Oleander</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a neon and flamingo-filled oasis in a basement with a side entrance down to the action, as well as vintage stores like </span><strong>Urban Jungle, Beacon&rsquo;s Closet</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the touring </span><strong>Mobile Vintage Shop</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and used book store </span><strong>Human Relations</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Perhaps the most unexpected of all is </span><a href=\"https://www.brooklynzoony.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brooklyn Zoo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an indoor training facility with recreated street scenes, complete with graffiti by local artists, which holds adult parkour classes, Ninja Warrior training, breakdancing classes and more. </span></p>\r\n<h1>The accessibility</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">East Williamsburg is arguably one of the best located neighborhoods in the whole of Brooklyn. The area is on the border of Greenpoint, Williamsburg, Bed-Stuy, Bushwick and Ridgewood &mdash; pretty much everywhere you&rsquo;ll ever need to go on nights or days out. This means that if you like walking, you can actually walk your way around Brooklyn, which is a pretty rare thing to be able to do. These neighboring areas all have their own unique personality, so you can head west into Williamsburg if you want to browse hipster </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coffee shops</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (or go to the Apple Store), north into Greenpoint for </span><strong>McCarren Park</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or perogies, east into Ridgewood for a leafy stroll or Bushwick for endless murals and the famous </span><strong>House of Yes</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">East Williamsburg House</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a 14-minute walk to McCarren Park, an 11-minute walk to Graham Avenue and a 28-minute walk to Broadway. East Williamsburg is also incredibly accessible to Manhattan, being on the west side of Brooklyn. From our East Williamsburg House, you can be in the East Village in just 25 minutes, making it the perfect base if you want a shorter commute into the city. Hop on the L train at Grand Street, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Montrose Avenue</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Morgan Avenue</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the J or the M at </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flushing Avenue</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or even the G (at the other Flushing) to go in and out of Manhattan, up and down Brooklyn and into Queens.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"Why East Williamsburg Is a Great Place to Live (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/EastWilliamsburg.jpg\" alt=\"Why East Williamsburg Is a Great Place to Live (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Credit: MySpace NYC Real Estate&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h1>The sheer number of bars and restaurants</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">East Williamsburg has access to the most bars and restaurants of any Brooklyn neighborhood and it seems like another joint pops up every week. According to </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@karlsluis/brooklyns-best-neighborhood-by-the-numbers-35631a58c30e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medium</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, within a mile&rsquo;s walk from anywhere in the neighborhood, you can find 316 restaurants and 196 bars, with everything from cocktails to Moroccan food to juice bars. Famous </span><strong>Roberta&rsquo;s</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> pizza</strong> was the original foothold of the neighborhood and is still one of the most popular spots for students and young professionals. This pizza place has an outdoor terrace with a relaxed and sociable vibe and its own Tiki Bar during the summer months. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For laid back glamour and a good old-fashioned grilled cheese and beer combo, try </span><strong>One Stop</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, just around the corner from our East Williamsburg House, or take a short walk to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grimm Artisanal Ales</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the local brewery. Our favorite brunch spot is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guadalupe Inn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which serves one of the best value bottomless brunches in Brooklyn, with delicious food and moorish mimosas. </span><strong>Norwind&rsquo;s </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also has an unmissable happy hour, while </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Well</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hosts regular live music events with a patio that&rsquo;s just perfect for summer.</span></p>\r\n<h1>...and coffee shops</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walking around, you&rsquo;ll be struck by the number of inviting signs for &ldquo;coffee&rdquo; hanging subtly in windows or doorways. What&rsquo;s great is that the vibe of most of these cafes is completely relaxed and, unlike many of their Manhattan equivalents, the servers don&rsquo;t mind you buying one coffee and staying there all day on your laptop. Our favorite is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ange Noir Cafe</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a sweet spot with comfy armchairs, a relaxed vibe and fast WiFi. The place is frequented weekly by the Bushwick Writer&rsquo;s Group, who hold regular workshops and &ldquo;shut up and write&rdquo; sessions here. This coffee shop also hosts regular concerts and stand-up comedy events in the back room.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right around the corner, </span><strong>Swallow Cafe</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is another welcoming place to work on your screenplay, and </span><strong>City of Saint Coffee Roasters</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has some of the best quality coffee in the city. The friendly staff at these spots stay open late, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about having to cut your day early at 5 p.m., making East Williamsburg the perfect place to get creative.</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"Why East Williamsburg Is a Great Place to Live (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-10%20at%202.48.44%20PM.png\" alt=\"Why East Williamsburg Is a Great Place to Live (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit: City of Saints Coffee Roasters/Instagram</span></em></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>The neighborhood is highly secure, and violent crime is incredibly infrequent.

Its small size means that at peak times there can be a line of ramen fans rolling out of the door, but before you panic, they also do take-out.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main thing Koko Ramen is famous for is its happy hour, which runs from 12-7pm everyday. Get a side dish of edamame, chicken wings or gyoza free with your ramen dish, or choose from a Japanese beer or hot sake for just $5. But Koko Ramen is so much more than just this deal.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Destination: Koko Ramen (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/o_3.jpg\" alt=\"Destination: Koko Ramen (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photo: Koko Ramen/ Facebook</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decor feels intimate and authentic, with lanterns dipping down at odd intervals and multi-colored ramen bowls and chopsticks stuck to the wooden panel walls. The seating consists of small wooden tables alongside bar stools looking out the front window, which adds&nbsp;to the community vibe. And of course, the friendly servers always bring your food out with a smile. The small size makes Koko the perfect place for a date or solo dining (but maybe not for a roommate group meal, unless you want half your group to be sat outside). If you&rsquo;re worried about getting a table, just be sure to go in the early evening or just before closing time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We loved the Roast Duck Ramen ($16), with roasted duck, bean sprouts, kikurage mushrooms, bok choy and ajitama (soft boiled) egg. Somehow, the duck remained crispy (as it should be!) even despite the broth. Koko is most famous for their Koko Tonkotsu Ramen ($14), made with creamy pork bone broth and pork belly kakuni, spinach, menma, and a soft boiled egg, which comes complete with two fatty chunks of quality pork. Koko has found the secret to making a creamy broth that&rsquo;s not too salty with thick noodles that absorb every ounce of its flavor. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pork Buns, Takoyaki and crispy Chicken Wings are also extremely popular with Brooklynites, who come from across the borough to get their ramen fix. Finish your meal with the Lava Cake, a flowing chocolate treat that truly melts in your mouth. Just make sure to head to an ATM before you check out Koko, because the restaurant is cash-only, although this certainly didn&rsquo;t spoil our night. Koko is a very special Flatbush institution indeed.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Destination: Koko Ramen (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/o4.jpg\" alt=\"Destination: Koko Ramen (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /><em>Photo: Alyssa S. / Yelp</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Koko Ramen</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">375 Marlborough Rd</span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brooklyn, NY 11226</span></em></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', 'o4.jpg', 1, '2019-04-16 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

This includes plastic water bottles, bags and straws. According to <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/every-minute-one-garbage-truck-of-plastic-is-dumped-into-our-oceans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Economic Forum</a>, humans produce 78 millions tons of plastic packaging every year, 32 percent of which is left to flow into our oceans, pouring the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic into the ocean every minute.</p>\r\n<h1>Use a reusable water bottle</h1>\r\n<p>When was the last time you bought a drink in a plastic bottle, then threw it away the same day? <a href=\"https://www.aiga.org/case-study-watershed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to AIGI, Americans purchase about 50 billion water bottles per year, averaging about 13 bottles per month.</a> Even aside from the environmental impact, this is an expensive way to stay hydrated.</p>\r\n<p>Thankfully, reusable water bottles are easy to pick up and very much in style right now. Brands like S&rsquo;well have managed to make them into fashion statements, with colorful designs and temperature-regulating materials, so you can use your bottle for hot coffee and tea as well as for cold drinks. S&rsquo;well even has a limited edition Earth Day bottle.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Earth Day: Small things you can do to help the planet (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/jonathan-chng-1057613-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Earth Day: Small things you can do to help the planet (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>BYO shopping bag</h1>\r\n<p>You can reduce your plastic (and therefore landfill) usage by using reusable shopping bags. <strong>Waste Management</strong> found that around 4 trillion plastic bags are used worldwide annually and only 1 percent of these are recycled. Although New York state is going to start charging us for plastic bags soon, there&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t start right now. You can get small and even fashionable fold-away bags like these on Amazon or at local grocery stores like Trader Joe&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<h1>Go strawless</h1>\r\n<p>The war on straws has begun! Half a billion straws are used in the world every day, which are probably the easiest things to cut out of your lifestyle. The anti-staw movement is fast gaining traction (read more at Plastic Pollution Coalition) and it&rsquo;s becoming a statement to reject a straw at a bar. You can also bring your own reusable straw if you can&rsquo;t go without.</p>\r\n<h1>Recycle</h1>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.recycleacrossamerica.org/recycling-facts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Recycle Across America</a>, ​U.S. recycling levels are currently 21.4 percent, mostly due to confusion about how to recycle, but if this were to reach 75 percent, it would be the environmental equivalent of removing 55 million cars from our roads each year. At Outpost, we want to move toward that target. We provide clearly labeled bins for recycling and landfill, so be sure to keep using these.

Maybe have one meatless day a week, or introduce one plant-based substitute into your diet.

We&rsquo;ve preserved the benefits of our current membership for Silver and Bronze members, while building benefits into the new Gold membership that are meant to make it as easy as possible to adjust if your plans change.</p>\r\n<p>Flight canceled? We&rsquo;ll work with you so you have somewhere to stay while you rebook. Friends in town last-minute for the weekend? They can stay for free, no problem. Opportunity of a lifetime taking you out of town for a few months? We&rsquo;ll pause your stay. Whatever life throws at you, our Gold membership is meant to take care of it.</p>\r\n<h2>How does this benefit me?</h2>\r\n<p>Outpost members at all levels will continue to enjoy the same benefits they&rsquo;ve gotten used to during their stay, like included utilities and WiFi, cleaning services, fully furnished houses, access to Outpost Club events and provided household essentials. We&rsquo;re committed to making Outpost a great place to live regardless of whether you choose the Gold, Silver or Bronze plan.</p>\r\n<p>Our Gold membership is a great opportunity to take full advantage of our new perks, even if you&rsquo;re only staying with us for a short time. Those perks include exclusive monthly pricing, the ability to have a guest stay at Outpost for free for four nights per month; your friends and family won&rsquo;t have to worry about finding a place to stay during their visit, and you won&rsquo;t have to worry about an overnight guest fee!</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also be able to pause your stay if your plans change for up to 90 days at any point during your membership, and you&rsquo;ll enjoy a free week&rsquo;s stay at an Outpost Club house at any point in the 6 months following the end of your membership and the flexibility to cancel your stay with 30 days&rsquo; notice for only $250.</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll see the full benefit of our exclusive monthly Gold rates if you&rsquo;re staying with us for even longer, as a Gold membership will pay for itself after 4 months.</p>\r\n<h2>What does it mean for my existing membership?</h2>\r\n<p>Nothing, unless you want it to!

Enjoy 52 acres of the most beautiful cherry blossoms, plus a timetable of events celebrating Japanese culture, including live music, dance performances, art demonstrations, tea ceremonies, Japanese inspired food and more. The garden has more than 200 trees, with rows of bright pink blossoms flowering all down Cherry Esplanade.</p>\r\n<p>You can even <strong>check the Cherry Watch</strong>, the <strong>Garden&rsquo;s web page that is updated each day</strong> with live updates on the petal blooming status of every tree in the main collection. Plus, the Botanic Garden is right by Prospect Park, as well as our Flatbush and <a href=\"../the-bed-stuy-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bed-Stuy</a> houses, so you can make a day of it. Find out more and get your tickets here or RSVP to the Facebook event here.</p>\r\n<h3>McCarren Park</h3>\r\n<p><strong>McCarren Park</strong> is a Brooklyn oasis of calm and happiness. It makes us even more happy now that there are cherry blossoms to stare at. This 35-acre greenland is a Brooklyn favorite, always filled with sunbathers, games of kickball, soccer and tennis, and runners. Located between Greenpoint and Williamsburg and right by our East Williamsburg House, the park is home to flowering Eastern Redbud trees this spring. These trees grow to about 30 feet tall and are lit up at nighttime for the perfect view.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Where to see the cherry blossoms in Brooklyn this weekend (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/brooklyn-botanic-garden-cherry-blossoms-5.jpg\" alt=\"Where to see the cherry blossoms in Brooklyn this weekend (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photo: Brownstoner</em></p>\r\n<h3>Prospect Park</h3>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not ready for the crowds or the ticket price of the official Cherry Blossom Festival, adjacent to the Botanic Garden is beautiful Prospect Park. Enter at the Grand Army Plaza and walk along the stone path in the Long Meadow to see the full view. You can look up where all the different types of trees and flowers will blossom in the park with the Prospect Park Alliance&rsquo;s <strong>Spring Bloom Guide</strong><a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/news-events/news/spring-bloom-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">.</a> Bring a picnic and spend your Saturday chilling on the grass beneath the cherry trees!</p>\r\n<h3>Greenwood Cemetery</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Greenwood Cemetery</strong> has both pink and white cherry blossom trees blooming. Walk along <strong>Battle Avenue</strong> and <strong>Crescent Water</strong> to see the highest number of trees, although the cherry blossoms are dotted all through the graves and mausoleums. The cemetery is famous and worth a visit on its own merits, being the home of beautiful stone architecture and the graves of several deceased famous New Yorkers.</p>\r\n<p>Brooklyn\'s cherry blossom season lasts from mid-March until late April. But different cherry tree species bloom at various times during the spring. While specific dates are difficult to predict, some trees usually bloom before others. Do not pass up the opportunity to see this lovely location.

Nowadays, the family vibe remains, but the refurbished townhouses and new options to eat, drink and play has attracted a younger, fashionable crowd. Here&rsquo;s our insight into why Boerum Hill is a great place to live.</p>\r\n<h3>The balance between quiet and busy</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boerum Hill has done a magical thing: it has managed to strike that perfect balance between quiet and busy. This is one of the reasons it&rsquo;s so popular with Manhattan commuters, particularly those working in Lower Manhattan and Wall Street. Boerum Hill is right in the West of Brooklyn, so the trendy atmosphere of the Lower East Side has made the jump across the Brooklyn Bridge. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, you&rsquo;ll be surprised by how quiet the neighborhood is when walking around from our </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Downtown Brooklyn House</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is located in the heart of the neighborhood. The airy streets are lined with trees and dog walkers in both summer and winter alike and the historic buildings, mostly consisting of three-story row houses built between 1840 and 1870, are some of the most beautiful in the city. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to see locals lounging on their stoops in the summer sun. Boerum Hill is one of those rare places where you can feel like you&rsquo;re in the middle of nowhere, when really you&rsquo;re always within a block or two of a restaurant, cafe or bar.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why Boerum Hill is a great place to live (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/carousel-large.jpg\" alt=\"Why Boerum Hill is a great place to live (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /><em>Photo: Brooklyn Bridge Park</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We love how Boerum Hill is just a 25 minute walk from the water; stand out on the pier at </span><strong>Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 5</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and marvel at the amazing Manhattan skyline in front of you. It feels like you&rsquo;ve walked to the edge of the earth, when really you&rsquo;re just a stone&rsquo;s throw from home. At the same time, you can walk onto any part of Smith Street or Atlantic Avenue, the two thoroughfares of Boerum Hill, and find rows of people sat outside chatting in the innumerable restaurants and cafes.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong>The independent vibe</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boerum Hill is full of independent cafes, restaurants and shops -- more so than any other Brooklyn neighborhood -- which makes exploring even more fun than usual. We love bar </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61 Local</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which holds regular writing workshops and open mic evenings through the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brooklyn Poets Yawp</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Little Sweet Cafe</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a popular cafe for daytime treats with a relaxed, old-world vibe, while </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greenlight Bookstore</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of our favorite independent bookstores in the entire city, with a program of regular talks and events. In fact, the whole of Smith Street is lined with restaurants and bars including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saul</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clover Club</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joya</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which has now become a destination spot for Brooklyn foodies, while Atlantic Avenue is a center for boutique shopping. Big names like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Adler</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nunu Chocolates</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have their flagship stores here, while specialty stores like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheryl Kleinman Cakes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acorn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gives this popular street a more intimate feel. Boerum Hill is also home to many artists who own art galleries in the neighborhood, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Invisible Dog Art Center</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roulette</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Issue Project Room</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BAM</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. All of this combined makes for a carefree atmosphere geared towards browsing, with a small town, outer-borough pace of life in a location just a few stops from Manhattan.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong>With one amazing exception</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not everything is independent, though. One thing about Boerum Hill which is reason enough to move here on its own is that it has one of only two </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trader Joe&rsquo;s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Brooklyn. Trader Joe&rsquo;s is a chain supermarket that is basically refrigerated wonderfulness: It&rsquo;s the best place to get good quality and affordable fruit and vegetables in NYC. There&rsquo;s also a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wholefoods</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so you&rsquo;ll be spoiled for choice for healthy options if you choose Boerum Hill as your base.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why Boerum Hill is a great place to live (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/0_4200_84_2716_two_nyc-midtown-florist-greenhouse-jbk0042.jpg\" alt=\"Why Boerum Hill is a great place to live (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /><em>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/locations/new-york/boerum-hill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Airbnb</a></em><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Did we mention the transport connections?</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boerum Hill is one of the best located Brooklyn neighborhoods, situated on the west side of Brooklyn. Our </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Downtown Brooklyn House</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in the heart of the neighborhood, is just a 34 minute journey to Times Square and a 21 commute to Wall Street. Bergen Street Station, in the middle of the neighborhood, is conveniently located on the F and the G lines, making travelling both into the city and around Brooklyn itself a breeze, while a short walk will bring you to the 2 and the 3 trains at Hoyt Street and the A and C trains at Hoyt-Schermerhorn for easy access to Downtown and Uptown Manhattan.</span></p>\r\n<p>All in all, we think the location combined with the relaxed vibes makes Boerum Hill an amazing place to live in Brooklyn and t&rsquo;s easy to see why it&rsquo;s one of the most popular neighborhoods in the city.</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>Do you still disagree that Boerum Hill is a fantastic place to live?

The streets are wide and leafy and there are plenty of parks in the area, including <strong>Paerdegat Park</strong><strong>,</strong> a tree-filled green space with sports courts, benches and a playground just a short walk from our <a href=\"../the-flatbush-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flatbush House</a>, and <strong>Holy Cross Cemetery</strong>, the burial ground of several noteworthy New Yorkers, such as the notorious Louis Capone. Our Flatbush House is also just a short walk from famous Prospect Park, Brooklyn&rsquo;s own version of Manhattan&rsquo;s Central Park.</p>\r\n<p>Designed by Olmsted and Vaux, the same brains behind <a href=\"../blog/the-9-most-instagrammable-spots-in-central-park\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Central Park</a>, this park is 526 acres of fresh air, including a man-made pond and the bulk of Brooklyn\'s remaining indigenous forest. This park even has its very own zoo and the first urban-area Audubon Center, as well as an ice rink, bandstand and athletic equipment. In the summer, Prospect Park is famous for its concerts and events as well a plenty of informal gatherings, including sports teams, joggers and picnickers. Bliss.</p>\r\n<h2>The range of eating, drinking and doing options</h2>\r\n<p>Flatbush is statistically one of the city&rsquo;s most diverse neighborhoods, which shows in the number of different things to eat, drink and do. <strong>Zurilee Pizza</strong> serves some of the best<strong> Caribbean pizza</strong>, starting at just $12 per pie. Their signature dish, the bake and saltfish pizza, is the star of the show and will leave you wanting more. We love Werkstatt for Viennese Bratwurst and schnitzel and Sip Unwine for delicious fusion tapas and fine wine.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Weird and wonderful combinations abound in Flatbush, including Brooklyn&rsquo;s first tattoo parlor and bar, <strong>FIB Tattoo Bar</strong>, and the bar-slash-flowershop&nbsp;<strong>Sycamore Bar and Flowershop</strong>. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.brooklyncenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College</a> is a great spot to see emerging and established artists, or for shopping we recommend <strong>Muffets Closet</strong> and <strong>Le Point</strong>. Flatbush Avenue and Cortelyou Road are the main hubs of culture and retail options, just a short walk from our Flatbush House.</p>\r\n<h2>The history</h2>\r\n<p>Flatbush is filled with history, something that will hit you when you walk by the large, expansive Victorian homes along Bedford Avenue and other pre-war houses near <a href=\"http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brooklyn College</a>. The neighborhood is the popular site of Brooklyn history tours, particularly for Victorian enthusiasts. The restored <a href=\"http://www.kingstheatre.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kings Theater</a> is a landmark in itself, having been built in 1929.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why Flatbush is a great place to live (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/kings-venue-2-1920x1280.jpg\" alt=\"Why Flatbush is a great place to live (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /><em>Photo: Kings Theatre</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This beautiful and decadent theatre seats more than 3,000 people. Originally a movie theatre, since its renovation and re-opening in 2010 it is now a live performance venue, with a program of varied events to entertain the neighborhood. Flatbush is also home to the <strong>Flatbush Reformed Dutch Church</strong>, built in 1654, and <strong>NYC&rsquo;s oldest high school</strong> (attended by Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond, and others).</p>\r\n<h2>The affordability</h2>\r\n<p>Flatbush is one of the more affordable Brooklyn neighborhoods. Flatbush Ave. is filled with discount stores and affordable Caribbean delis, and many of our favorite cafes, restaurants and bars have excellent deals. For instance, <strong>Koko Ramen</strong> has a daily happy hour from 12 p.m.&ndash;7 p.m. on both drinks and food, and our favorite Mexican restaurant, <strong>Taqueria Maria and Ricardo</strong>, serves tostadas starting at just $4.95.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why Flatbush is a great place to live (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2013228-dollar-van2.jpg\" alt=\"Why Flatbush is a great place to live (Image-4)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /><em>Photo: BlogTO.com</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Flatbush is also one of the only Brooklyn neighborhoods to have <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_van\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dollar vans</a></strong>. Think of these as a mixture between Uber Pool and the bus: You pay $2 and you can hop on the van&rsquo;s pre-set route, hopping off again at your stop. It&rsquo;s quick and convenient and above all, cheap. You can find out more information and download the app here. We think that&rsquo;s reason enough on its own to consider living in Flatbush, particularly in the wake of the L-train slowdown, don&rsquo;t you?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After considering these points, if you still feel confident, we will be pleased to assist you in finding a <a href=\"../new-york\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rental home</a> in this lovely area. You won\'t be dissatisfied with Flatbush, and we will make every effort to give you the nicest home possible.</p>', 'Flatbush-what-to-expect-1.jpg', 1, '2019-05-30 05:00:00', '2022-11-01 07:16:24', NULL, 0, 0),

Getting your mail is simple (we&rsquo;ve explained it in a dedicated <a href=\"../blog/ask-a-house-leader-how-does-getting-mail-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>) and your house leader is always ready to answer any mail-related questions. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when the time comes that you move on from Outpost to a new home (sob), you have to take a few steps to change your mailing address:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fill out a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">change of address form</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with USPS as soon as you move out, or even a day or two before. This is the fastest and easiest way to change your address. All you need is an email address and you&rsquo;ll get an instant confirmation that the change has been processed. This should only cost you a dollar. (There are some scammers offering to do this for a service fee of $40 -- avoid these!)</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don&rsquo;t like doing things online, you can also go to your </span><a href=\"https://tools.usps.com/go/POLocatorAction_input\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">local post office</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and request a Mover&rsquo;s Guide packet, in which you&rsquo;ll find a PS Form 3575. Just fill this out at the counter and hand it in at the post office (this option can take up to five business days).</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that life is hectic and it&rsquo;s only human to forget to change your address with the stress of moving out.

They also do a mean iced soy latte, lavender latte and hazelnut latte, making their own syrups in house, which go perfectly with their Yuzu pound cake, selection of cookies or Kona Coffee Macaron.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>1640 Post St, 94115 (1-minute walk from our Japantown House)</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Cafe Hana</strong></h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cafe Hana is the closest affordable caffeine fix to our Japantown House. Located just a 1-minute walk from your front door in the Japan </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Center\'s West Mall, this cosy coffee shop is your first stop for specialty drinks, sandwiches and pastries. Their food and snack menu is extensive, including sandwiches, ice cream, coffee and jelly drinks, making it one of the most popular coffee shops in the mall. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coffee starts at just $2 a cup, ranging from plain old drip coffee to adventurous treats like the famous </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geisha Float and \"Frios.\" This Japanese cafe is famous for its affordable takoyaki, which make a great snack at $5 for six pieces. Just be aware that seating is limited, so it&rsquo;s more of a grab and go place than somewhere to stand and stare. </span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>1737 Post St, 94115 (1-minute walk)</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"9 Five Japantown Coffee Shops We Love (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/o_7.jpg\" alt=\"Five Japantown Coffee Shops We Love (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photo: Cris L., Yelp</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Quetzal Internet Cafe</strong></h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Quetzal is a good option if you want a coffee shop with a large variety of food, including both indulgent and healthy options, as well as comfortable chairs. Enjoy a choice of bagels, lattes, smoothies and crepes, starting at just $4.95. With outlets and ethernet connections at most seats and quick, reliable WiFi, it&rsquo;s a great place to work. And as day turns to night, we&rsquo;re fans of their happy hour, which runs daily from 3 p.m.&ndash;9 p.m. with wine ($5.95), beer ($4.25) and mimosas ($5.95) at reduced prices.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>1234 Polk St, 94109 (13-minute walk)</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Cafe Murano</strong></h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This bright, yellow-walled cafe is a cute spot to meet or study any time of the week, with a range of comfy couches to nestle into and even outdoor, cafe-style tables for the summer months.

It&rsquo;s not a place to work, but to relax. In fact, part of the quirkiness is that no one is ever quite sure when Tan Tan will open; its friendly owner simply opens when she feels like it.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>1825 Post St, 94115 (4-minute walk)</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>Japanese society is known for its minimalism, and residents frequently favor cozy, compact homes.

Here are our top picks of the ones to read during quarantine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>1. Jane Eyre</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jane-Eyre-AmazonClassics-Charlotte-Bront&euml;-ebook/dp/B0721B7NPX/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Jane+eyre&amp;qid=1587467569&amp;sr=8-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jane Eyre</a></em> is the perfect inspiration story for quarantine. Why? You&rsquo;re hard pressed to find such a tough cookie as Jane in classic literature who still always maintains her sense of kindness. She bears her turbulent life with the most positive outlook, always ready to see the good in people and willing to share the little that she has with others. It&rsquo;s an incredibly heartwarming story filled with twists and turns; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s Gothic masterpiece will transport you from your cramped apartment straight to nineteenth century England (and whether you&rsquo;re identifying more with Jane or the madwoman in the attic right now is up to you!)</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>2. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there were ever a time we needed to escape to a magical realm through our wardrobes, it would be now. Take a trip to Narnia with C.S. Lewis&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lion-Witch-Wardrobe-Chronicles-Narnia/dp/0064404994/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1AGALKD9TQHH2&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+lion+the+witch+and+the+wardrobe&amp;qid=1587467611&amp;sprefix=the+lion+the%2Caps%2C220&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">timeless tale</a> full of fauns, dwarves and turkish delight and let Mr Tumnes cheer you up, whether you&rsquo;re a Peter, Edmund, Susan or Lucy. Even though it&rsquo;s a children&rsquo;s book, this tale is beautifully written and perfect to dive into over a hot cup of coffee in your lunch break.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>3. Mrs Spring Fragrance</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the theme of childhood escapism, we love Sui Sin Far&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Spring-Fragrance-Collection-Chinese-American-ebook/dp/B00GSV9D9E/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mrs+spring+fragrance&amp;qid=1587467686&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mrs Spring Fragrance</a></em></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a classic of Chinese-American literature. This popular short story collection written in the late 19th and 20th centuries are a mixture of stories for adults and for children set in Seattle and San Francisco. Chronicling the struggles and joys of Chinese families in North America, Sui Sin Far weaves classic Chinese folklore stories with her personal experiences to explore the conflicts between Eurasians and recent immigrants in a touching, meaningful way.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>4. Frankenstein</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Mary Shelley&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Frankenstein-Mary-Shelley/dp/1512308056/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Frankenstein+Mary+shelley&amp;qid=1587467791&amp;sr=8-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frankenstein</a>&nbsp;</em>tells the story of Victor Frankentein, a young scientist who conducts a crazy scientific experiment, creating a hideous creature which takes on a life of its own. This short novel mixes Gothic and Sci-Fi elements in a fascinating narrative, raising important questions about friendship, taking responsibility for your actions and the ever important debate of nature versus nurture. It&rsquo;s also a gripping read that will make you forget your quarantine blues (and make you thankful to be tucked away inside your home and not outside with the monsters!)</p>\r\n<h1><strong>5. Mrs Dalloway</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Dalloway-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156628708/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mrs+dalloway&amp;qid=1587467906&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">masterpiece novel</a> is a favorite of many. It&rsquo;s also a perfect read for quarantine. Woolf&rsquo;s exploration of time and the little moments of life which make up the bigger picture will make you appreciate that in-joke with a friend on the phone or even that occasional walk to the grocery store, making you realise that time can be fluid and broken down in many ways, even in these strange times we find ourselves in. Woolf also explores trauma and psychoanalysis while remaining uplifting and charming in tone, making you fall in love with the world of Clarissa Dalloway (even if you can&rsquo;t have your own party!)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Bonus: The Argonauts</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, this one is a modern classic. Maggie Nelson&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Argonauts-Maggie-Nelson/dp/1555977359/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Maggie+Nelson+the+argonauts&amp;qid=1587467973&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2015 memoir</a> about love, gender, gender theory, having children and queer family making is an incredibly touching quarantine read. Nelson weaves in critical theory to her own experiences, meditating on the practical implications for her life and the lives of her reader&rsquo;s, as we watch her deal with queerphobia, gender stereotyping and familial realities in this beautifully written work of &ldquo;autotheory.&rdquo;</span></p>', '2_17.jpg', 1, '2020-04-21 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

We laughed, we screamed, we got glitter in our eyes ... I had some beautiful conversations with people I&rsquo;ve come to care about and had an absolute blast. I can&rsquo;t wait until next year.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel told us: &lsquo;It was my first pride event that I had the chance to attend. I was lucky enough to be in a city which is not only famous for having the best pride celebrations in the world, but is also where it all began. Being part of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots has been an amazing experience. As a proud member of the queer community, it was awesome to celebrate love, freedom and equality for all our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters.

One of my favorite times was the introduction of corn hole in our backyard at South Williamsburg. I had a lot of fun discovering this game and sharing this unique moment with different members of the Outpost community, some of whom I would say were expert-level corn hole competitors. I also love spending time on the roof with other Outpost members, sharing our stories, doing our evening workout or just simply sitting quietly and listening to the city being alive around us &hellip; all of these become exceptional moments when in NYC.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite part of New York?</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My favorite part of New York? That\'s a tough one, because each corner of New York City has its own beauty. I love the vibrant energy running through the city. I think it is the high concentration of diversity in one unique, beautiful town, which gives such a strong and fierce personality to NYC. You can be anyone, do anything, and there is always something new and fun to discover. In fact, writing this post has inspired me to get out and get to know New York City even more.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>What are you working on now?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am working on developing and discovering new skills.

Check out a museum</strong></strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Museums and galleries abound in New York, and almost all of them have super-strong AC alongside mind-expanding exhibitions. Our top recommendation goes to </span><strong><a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Met</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, simply because it&rsquo;s so big that you could spend an entire day there gazing at the more than 5,000 years of art history &mdash; plus, it offers pay-what-you-wish admission for New York residents, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about breaking the bank.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also love the Mela Foundation&rsquo;s </span><strong>Dream House</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a brightly colored space filled with AC and pillows to whittle the day and night away, as well as </span><strong>The New York Earth Room</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a giant display room filled with cooling earth across the floor.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>2. Head to an indoor garden</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The city has several indoor gardens that allow you to enjoy the best of nature while still feeling the AC breeze. Our favorite is the </span><a href=\"https://tclf.org/landscapes/ford-foundation-atrium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ford Foundation Atrium</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> nearby Grand Central, tucked away inside glass panels in the Ford Foundation building. This 160-foot-tall garden is filled with trees and tropical plants, and even has its own reflection pool. It&rsquo;s the perfect place to enjoy fresh air without the moisture of the NYC outdoors.</span></p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"7 ways to escape the humidity in NYC (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/o_11.jpg\" alt=\"7 ways to escape the humidity in NYC (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo:&nbsp;<em>Christin M., Yelp</em></p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>3. Shop inside</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air-conditioned malls are an obvious way to escape the humidity, although in New York there&rsquo;s more to it than that. We love </span><strong>Brookfield Place</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for window-shopping and dining in the summertime, but there are also plenty of less conventional mall options, including flea markets like </span><strong>The Alley Flea Market</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Bushwick or </span><strong>Artists &amp; Fleas</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Williamsburg, which include indoor areas.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>4. Play some games</strong></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board game cafes are your answer to air-conditioned, daytime fun. We love </span><strong>The Uncommons</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> near Washington Square Park as an escape from the heavy NYC air. Enjoy a selection of hundreds of boardgames, as well as coffee, WiFi and good vibes.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"7 ways to escape the humidity in NYC (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/o_14.jpg\" alt=\"7 ways to escape the humidity in NYC (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Photo:&nbsp;<em>Mandi W., Yelp</em></span></p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>5.

Schwarzman Building</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> branch for its imposing architecture and cool white marble.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>6. Check out a Broadway show</strong></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;re looking for an indoor activity without the high temperatures, why not check out a Broadway or an Off-Broadway show? These shows are a major NYC bucket-list item and often have affordable tickets for the lunchtime matinees. Try </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TodayTix</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for reduced-price seats or turn up at the box office early in the morning for cheap same-day tickets.</span></p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>7. If you have to be outside&hellip;</strong></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sometimes the best things are outside. If you have to or want to be out in the humidity, make sure you wear lightweight clothing. Another tip is to bring a second shirt to change into after your sweaty walk or subway expedition, so you can arrive looking half decent at your destination. Even with the humidity, NYC is still buzzing with things to see and do in the summer.</p>\r\n<p>Don\'t overlook the wonderful activity you enjoy doing at home. The pace of life in New York is unique, and occasionally, just looking out the window can elicit strong emotions. What could be more enjoyable than a cup of coffee in the morning with a friend? <a href=\"../coliving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Living together</a>, of course, since spending the summer in New York with pals is worthwhile.</p>', 'JACKSON_SEASON19_SHOWIMAGES_1238x520_v35-6042a653ee.jpg', 1, '2019-07-18 05:00:00', '2022-11-01 07:09:45', NULL, 0, 0),

The name </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a reference to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stonehenge</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which was constructed so that the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rising sun</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, seen from the center of the monument at the time of the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">summer solstice</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, aligns with the outer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heel Stone</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;re into the details, the reason for Manhattanhenge is that the street grid for most of Manhattan is rotated 29&deg; clockwise from true east-west, which means when the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">azimuth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sunset</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is 299&deg;, the sunset aligns with the streets on that grid.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to catch Manhattanhenge tonight, make sure you&rsquo;re in the city by 8 p.m. The sun will set at 8:20 p.m, but it&rsquo;s good to arrive beforehand to see the changing colors of the sky &mdash; and you may have to fight to get a good spot among the crowds of tourists and locals who will flock to the streets for the occasion.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Tonight&rsquo;s Manhattanhenge: What it is and where to watch it (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/Unknown.jpg\" alt=\"Tonight&rsquo;s Manhattanhenge: What it is and where to watch it (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo: <em>Accuweather</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best places for viewing Manhattanhenge are 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd, and 57th streets. Because the sun sets in the west, it&rsquo;s not too important which avenue you choose to stand on, although the wider the cross street, the better. Because the best shots will include plenty of NYC skyscrapers in the background, we recommend not standing too far west. Our pick would be 42nd street and either Lexington or 3rd avenues, so you get the beautiful Chrysler Building in your shot.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will also be another opportunity to catch the sunset at the same time tomorrow, although this will only be a half disk, so the main show will certainly be tonight.

Located on the west side of San Francisco, bordering beautiful Ocean Beach, it&rsquo;s the ideal place to relax.</p>\r\n<p>Start on the east side of the park near historic McLaren Lodge and work your way westward through this expansive park, preferably with a good book in hand. You&rsquo;ll be struck almost instantly by the Conservatory of Flowers, an imposing Victorian building made mostly of glass. Walk along the flowerbeds and palm trees of Conservatory Valley to get a closer look: This beautiful building, opened in 1879, is the oldest building in Golden Gate Park. Step inside and explore the 1,700 species of aquatic and tropical plants this expansive green house holds, including orchids, giant water lillies and carnivorous plants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Getting lost for a day in Golden Gate Park (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/o_16.jpg\" alt=\"Getting lost for a day in Golden Gate Park (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo: <em>David G. Yelp</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Conservatory regularly holds special exhibits, so you may be lucky enough to stumble upon a limited-edition horticultural display. You&rsquo;ll also probably see one of the many geckos that are used instead of harmful pesticides to keep pests away. During the summer months (this year through Oct. 21), the Conservatory is illuminated from 9 p.m. to 11:30 p.m., transforming this landmark into a colorful artefact with spinning flower images, animated butterflies and more. And if you&rsquo;re still hungry for plantlife after this, try the adjacent Arizona Garden and Dahlia Garden or the Botanic Garden, with collections of rhododendrons, camellias, magnolias, succulents and more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, walk onwards to the Music Concourse, a landscaped basin between the </span><strong>California Academy of Sciences </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and the </span><strong>de Young Museum</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This green space hosts free concerts on Sundays during the summer and there are always picnickers and bookworms sitting in the sunshine and shade alike. At the center of the Music Concourse is the beautiful Rideout Fountain. Built in 1924, this fountain will soothe your soul &mdash; plus, the ring of benches around it is perfect for people-watching.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Getting lost for a day in Golden Gate Park (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/o_17.jpg\" alt=\"Getting lost for a day in Golden Gate Park (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo:&nbsp;<em>Golden Gate Park</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The next stop is the Japanese Tea Garden, one of our favorite places in the park. With free admission on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings, this garden is your ticket to relaxation. It&rsquo;s actually the oldest Japanese tea garden in the United States and was originally created for the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition as the fair&rsquo;s Japanese Village exhibit. The entire garden is landscaped in the Japanese style, with winding paths running through its 3.5 acres of carefully chosen plants, which include Japanese maples, twisting pines, clipped azaleas and flowering cherry trees. Walk past koi ponds, stone lanterns, wooden gates and more. We love the hundred-year-old five-story pagoda and the high-arching Drum Bridge, which reflects in the pond below. The teahouse is the best place to take a break from your walk, with a wide selection of teas and other hot drinks to keep you hydrated.</p>\r\n<p>Stroll past the loungers spread out on the grass of the Great Meadow and enjoy the sight of egrets and ducks in the waterfowl pond as you make your way through to Stow Lake, the park&rsquo;s largest body of water. This lake, opened in 1893, was designed for leisure boating, and you can still rent a pedal boat from the boathouse. Take a small hike up Strawberry Hill Island, the highest point in Golden Gate Park at more than 400 feet, which is situated in the middle of the lake, to get the best view. Follow the trail at the lake&rsquo;s perimeter and you&rsquo;ll reach Huntington Falls, a 110-foot artificial waterfall that cascades from a reservoir higher up on Strawberry Hill.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Getting lost for a day in Golden Gate Park (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/o_18.jpg\" alt=\"Getting lost for a day in Golden Gate Park (Image-4)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo: <em>Golden Gate Park</em></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continue through the National AIDS Memorial Grove, a reflective space filled with rhododendrons and redwoods, and peep in on the buffalo at the Bison Paddock to really feel a sense of getting back to nature. The Herschell-Spillman Carousel is an ideal place to experience the thrill of childhood again, originally built in 1914 and colorfully painted with scenes of farmyard animals and the Bay Area. This indoor, historic carousel costs just $2 for adults to ride and is certainly a blast from the past.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finish your wander at the Park Chalet restaurant, a cafe and restaurant beside the beach with panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean. All we can say after that is well done; you&rsquo;ve earned that ice cream (or beer!).</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', 'o_2.jpg', 1, '2019-07-25 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Coliving is a new way of living that has become extremely popular in New York -- and for good reason. Read on to find out why you should consider co-living this autumn semester.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why coliving is better than college dorms this autumn (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1.jpg\" alt=\"Why coliving is better than college dorms this autumn (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></strong></strong></p>\r\n<h1><strong><strong>1. It&rsquo;s more flexible</strong></strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a college dorm, you either sign up for the entire year or not at all. That&rsquo;s a big commitment and a gamble that you&rsquo;ll like the neighborhood, your roommates, and dorm life in general. With co-living, life is more flexible. At Outpost, our minimum contract period is only a month, which you can extend once you&rsquo;re sure you like us. What&rsquo;s even better is that with our gold membership, you can sign up for the entire semester or year and still have the freedom to move between any of our eleven houses in New York (and even our houses in San Francisco for vacations) at any time, which means you can change neighborhoods or roommates if you&rsquo;re unhappy or simply want to try something new.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why coliving is better than college dorms this autumn (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/09.jpg\" alt=\"Why coliving is better than college dorms this autumn (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>2. It&rsquo;s more affordable</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">College dorms can vary in price, but what co-living offers is a completely all inclusive rate, with all the things you didn&rsquo;t even know you needed provided for you. When you first move into a college dorm, start-up costs can really catch you off guard. Buying hangers, bedding, toiletries and seasonings are all hidden costs that can really add up on a student budget. When you move into Outpost, everything&rsquo;s included. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You kitchen comes filled with everything from cutlery to cooking equipment, paper towels to a coffee maker. Your bathroom will be decked out and regularly re-stocked with soap, shampoo, toilet paper and even a hairdryer. We even have co-working spaces with printers and regularly re-stocked ink.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bedroom will be move-in ready, with a memory foam mattress and pillow, extension cords to your bedside, shelving, hooks, hangers and even bed linens and a towel, so all you need to bring is your suitcase.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>3. It&rsquo;s cleaner&nbsp;</strong></h1>\r\n<p>You may have heard the horror stories about communal floor bathrooms and kitchens in college dorms, particularly Freshman dorms. The rumors are true. Dorm bathrooms are often shared between a large number of people and may not be cleaned regularly--so much so that it&rsquo;s common practice for students to wear flip-flops in the shower in order to avoid fungal infections. At Outpost, we have plenty of bathrooms and always at least one kitchen located within your private, shared apartment. These are cleaned weekly by our in-house cleaning team, who even re-stock everything from toilet paper to salt, so you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about waiting in line or trying to find a clean mug again.</p>\r\n<p><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why coliving is better than college dorms this autumn (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/4th%20July-9_1.jpg\" alt=\"Why coliving is better than college dorms this autumn (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></strong></p>\r\n<h1><strong>4. You&rsquo;ll meet a wider variety of people&nbsp;</strong></h1>\r\n<p>College dorms are often populated with 18 year olds, running around in togas, studying similar things. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, but co-living allows you to get out of this bubble. At Outpost, you&rsquo;ll meet a variety of people from all over the world, of all ages and occupations. Graduate students in particular will find relief from the typical frat house culture of college dorms and almost all students agree it&rsquo;s nice to have roommates who can connect you back to the real world. Outpost holds regular community events to help you meet people both people in your own house and in other houses, so there&rsquo;s a wide choice of things to do, from parties, to beach trips, to writing groups.</p>\r\n<p><strong><img title=\"Why coliving is better than college dorms this autumn (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2.jpg\" alt=\"Why coliving is better than college dorms this autumn (Image-4)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></strong></p>\r\n<h1><strong>5. It feels more like home</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most college dorms haven&rsquo;t been refurbished for several generations and almost all have an industrial, cold feel about them. At Outpost, all of our homes are newly</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> renovated and we&rsquo;ve worked with interior designers to create the most modern, comfortable spaces possible. There&rsquo;s heat and air conditioning in every room, as well as state of the art appliances, hardwood floors and advanced security systems in common areas. There&rsquo;s also more space to hang out than in your average dorm, as most of our houses have backyards or rooftops and every one has dedicated co-working space. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also provide laundry facilities on-site in every house (even if we can&rsquo;t provide a parent who will do it for you&hellip;).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', '4th July-52.jpg', 1, '2019-08-05 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

I recently finished my studies in Chemistry and I decided to take a break far from home by coming to NYC!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have always been passionate about filling my life with new adventures and staying in NYC with Outpost is my latest one!&nbsp;I love outdoor activities, meeting new people and learning about them, including sharing life experiences, as well as singing and dancing (especialy latin rythims like salsa or bachata!).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1>What\'s your favorite Outpost memory?</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\'s hard to pick! One good memory&nbsp;with Outpost was&nbsp;the Roaring 20\'s party we had at the Knickerbocker House. All the House Leaders met up before to help set up the party.

The speedy WiFi and calm atmosphere is the ideal environment for work, added to by the hardwood floors, large windows and comfy chairs. Choose from a full coffee, breakfast and lunch menu, including a long list of espresso-based drinks featuring a local roast: Sightglass coffee. The food is made daily from scratch and the cold pressed juice is the perfect workday fuel.</span></p>\r\n<h3>Verve Coffee Roasters</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verve is like something out of a design magazine: a relaxed coffee shop with pine, pastels, plants and art, making it the most inspirational place for your work day. Sink into the comfortable window seats and watch the baristas at work from behind a glass screen as you wonder how they managed to make the coffee this good. The group tables with plenty of laptop space are perfect for co-working, and the reliable WiFi will keep you productive throughout the day. Verve roasts its own coffee in its flagship location, Santa Cruz, meaning it&rsquo;s always fresh and sustainable. Try the nitro flash cold brew with oat milk for the perfect caffeine hit (and maybe a sandwich, too).</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Our top 5 remote and co-working spots in San Francisco (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_2.jpg\" alt=\"Our top 5 remote and co-working spots in San Francisco (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo:&nbsp;<em>Lillian C.

This light and airy space is filled with wooden tables and good vibes, with trees peering in from outside, and you can rest assured while you work through the day that all of the food and coffee you buy is sustainably sourced. The coffee is locally roasted, direct-trade from Four Barrel Coffee and you can pick anything from sandwiches to their ever-popular homemade scones. There&rsquo;s even beer and wine for when you&rsquo;re feeling the writer&rsquo;s block. Together with the friendly staff and quick WiFi, it&rsquo;s a great place to work remotely.</span></p>\r\n<h3>Workshop Cafe</h3>\r\n<p>What some call the future of co-working, Workshop Cafe has two locations in SF. It&rsquo;s basically a mixture of a library, an office and a coffee shop, with colorful, modern decor, comfy chairs and an industrial-style setting. There are multiple work areas, including booths (each with their own outlet), easy chairs and stools, spread across an open-plan warehouse, with a cafe at the far end selling coffee, sandwiches, juice and everything else you could need to be productive. The one snag is the price: You pay per hour and reserve your seat, in a sort of short-term version of WeWork. But believe us, with features including seamless WiFi and the ability to suggest music for the curated playlist, it&rsquo;s certainly worth investing in to get your work done.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Our top 5 remote and co-working spots in San Francisco (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/21.jpg\" alt=\"Our top 5 remote and co-working spots in San Francisco (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo: <em>Workshop Cafe&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h3>Golden Gate Park</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why not head outdoors for a day of remote working? The city introduced free public WiFi in 2014, so you can access your files in the great outdoors. We love sitting by the observatory in Golden Gate Park, with the shade angled perfectly over our laptop screen and the world of remote working at our fingertips.</span></p>\r\n<p>A work trip to San Francisco is fantastic.

In the hunt for a traditional apartment, you might find yourself having to pay a broker fee. In NYC, broker fees are notoriously high, averaging one month&rsquo;s rent or 15% of the annual rent according to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Hauseit/how-much-are-broker-fees-for-renting-an-apartment-in-nyc-363c96a35729\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Medium</a>. That&rsquo;s $1,000 or more gone instantly, although if you&rsquo;re lucky you might find one of the newly popular no-fee brokers (so long as you&rsquo;re able to avoid a scam).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On top of that is the application fee for the apartment, averaging around $100 or more, while at Outpost we don&rsquo;t charge application fees or undertake extensive reference checks, making moving in both affordable and quick.</p>\r\n<p>Apartments in New York and San Francisco don&rsquo;t usually come furnished, so unless you&rsquo;re lucky enough to find a perfectly timed sublet, you&rsquo;re looking at buying at least a bed and a dresser &mdash; if not more (depending on how fancy you&rsquo;re feeling).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re scrimping and saving; at a minimum you&rsquo;ll spend $100 on a bed frame and $100 on a mattress, while most people will end up spending more in the region of $400 for both. A dresser will be another $40 - $200. Then there&rsquo;s the living room... unless you want to sit on your pizza boxes for a year, a couch will set you back anywhere between $200 to $600 (but let&rsquo;s veer on the conservative side and say you find a roommate willing to split it with you).</p>\r\n<p><em>Start-up cost savings of fully furnished coliving: $440 - $2000.</em></p>\r\n<p>After these one-time expenses, the monthly fees begin. So how much money can you save per month by coliving?</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Monthly saving on utilities &hellip; and more</strong></h1>\r\n<p><img title=\"How much money you can save by coliving (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_3.jpg\" alt=\"How much money you can save by coliving (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In an Outpost coliving house, all of your utilities are included, even WiFi. According to <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-the-cost-of-living-in-new-york-city\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smart Asset</a>, The average basic utilities package for a 915-square-foot apartment in New York costs $145.55, including heating, electricity and water. WiFi prices average at $62.77 per month, and that&rsquo;s without having super speedy unlimited access and streaming. Even if you share with a roommate, that&rsquo;s $72.78 on utilities and $31.39 on WiFi. Anybody else starting to lose count?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Savings per month on utilities and WiFi: $104.17 - $208.32.</em></p>\r\n<h1><strong>All the little things</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Outpost also provides all those little things that add up without you realizing that they do. So let&rsquo;s try to add them &hellip; Your bathroom is regularly restocked with toilet paper ($0.84 per roll, with the assumption two rolls a week are being used per person [feel free to debate that one]), as well as shower gel ($3 - $9 per bottle, per month) and shampoo (another $3 - $9 per bottle, per month). There&rsquo;s also a hairdryer, but let&rsquo;s say you brought one with you.</p>\r\n<p>In the coliving area, we include Netflix ($8.99 per month) as well as a printer and ink (costing between $1 and $10 per month, depending if you&rsquo;re a student or work from home).</p>\r\n<p>In the kitchen, we provide olive oil ($3 - $8 per bottle), as well as spices ($5 per month average), paper towels ($2 per month) and coffee and tea ($12 per month minimum). Then there&rsquo;s dish soap and garbage bags ($2 per month minimum). That&rsquo;s not even counting the kitchen utensils and little things in your bedroom&hellip; like hangers (who ever remembers hangers?) and the added benefits of cleaning and security that living at Outpost offers.</p>\r\n<p><em>Savings on the little things: $46.71 - much, much more.</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"How much money you can save by coliving (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/3_7.jpg\" alt=\"How much money you can save by coliving (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>That means that by coliving, even the thriftiest shopper can save $440 in start-up fees, as well as $150.88 per month at a minimum (and are you really buying that $3 shampoo every month?). Now, doesn&rsquo;t that make you feel less guilty about getting that extra drink at the bar last weekend? Cheers!</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', '1_1.jpg', 1, '2019-09-05 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Even if you don&rsquo;t feel like talking, it&rsquo;s nice to know you have the option to whine about your job over a glass of wine while you cook or watch Netflix in the common area.</p>\r\n<h1>All the fun social events</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outpost runs regular events in our houses, with everything from wine and cheese nights to special celebrations on holidays.

This means that you can meet members from any number of our houses at our events, expanding your social circle far beyond the confines of your individual house. And of course, if you have gold membership you can even hop around houses in your city to experience life (and the social life) at other Outpost locations.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"On the pros of coliving: The social side (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/3_10.jpg\" alt=\"On the pros of coliving: The social side (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have Facebook groups for each of our houses where events and hang outs are posted as well as a Facebook Group which spans all houses across your city.

And you wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong. Cafe Erzulie sells a selection of flowers and plants, with creeping leaves blending into the decor and adorning the beautifully appointed garden in the back (obviously atmospherically set off by lashings of golden string lights). But Cafe Erzulie is so much more than a flower shop.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Destination: Cafe Erzulie (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/5.jpg\" alt=\"Destination: Cafe Erzulie (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Photo: Cafe Erzulie, <em>Facebook</em></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the day, the space is a chilled out coffee shop perfect for sitting with your laptop and soaking up some rays in the garden. The hidden nature of Cafe Erzulie means it&rsquo;s tranquil during the day, providing a great environment to work. Nibble away on everything from sandwiches to salads to pastries, secure in the knowledge that all the food is made from scratch daily. The coffee comes from local roasters, Devocion, and the tea is supplied by popular tea atelier, Bellocq. Espressos start at $3 and you can also get cappuccinos, lattes and all the other usuals to fuel you through that remote working day.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By night, Cafe Erzulie switches into a hip cocktail bar with dim lights, cheap drinks and a laid back atmosphere, open late from wednesdays through Sunday. The Haitian-inspired bar is most known for its live music, with regular jazz nights in the garden during the week and at weekends. You&rsquo;ll find everything from Afro-Carribean bands to Brazilian funk to hip hop nights and live DJs, all with that classic Brooklyn feel.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Destination: Cafe Erzulie (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/3_11.jpg\" alt=\"Destination: Cafe Erzulie (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo: <em>Bushwick Daily</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kick back with a glass of wine or beer with prices starting at just $6. The delicious cocktails start at $10 and include a range of inventive concoctions as well as the typical classics. We love the &ldquo;Flowers by Leslie&rdquo;, celebrating the flowers sold next to the bar itself, which consists of mint and cucumber, St-Germain and vodka. Happy Hour hits every wednesday through saturday from 4pm to 9pm, which includes discounts on both drinks and food. Our favorite Happy Hour eats are the Tacos Crole (chicken or pork tacos with pickle and green cabbage slaw) for just $4.50, and the stuffed plantain ($7).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If music isn&rsquo;t your thing, there are other themed nights to suit any taste, including free comedy nights every second and fourth wednesday of the month. Recently, we experienced a yoga and meditation session with live music, drinks and positive energy, billed as a &ldquo;spiritual twerk&rdquo; night. Being under the radar, all Cafe Erzulie&rsquo;s events are announced on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their Instagram</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the week or night of the show, so be sure to follow them for the latest news.

Try a heated rooftop bar</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NYC is famous for its rooftop bars, but what most people don&rsquo;t know is that many of the city&rsquo;s rooftops are weather-proofed during the winter, equipped with heating to make sure you can stay at a comfortable temperature while still enjoying the skyline views. Our favorite heated rooftop for after work drinks is </span><strong>The Press Lounge</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boasting arguably the best views in Manhattan as well as floor to ceiling glass windows, seconded only by </span><strong>Magic Hour</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whose indoor awning somehow keeps the famous carousel ticking on throughout the colder months. And if you&rsquo;re looking for a rooftop club, </span><strong>Le Bain</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a favorite among Outpost members for dancing in the clouds (even in the snow).</span></p>\r\n<h1>2. Jump into a \"Sofar\" gig</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"5 hot-spots for those cold NYC winter nights (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_10.jpg\" alt=\"5 hot-spots for those cold NYC winter nights (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Photo:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sofar Sounds</span></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Sofar Sounds</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the city&rsquo;s go-to provider of new indie music talent. Almost every day, a Sofar Sounds show is taking place in NYC, showcasing the latest unsigned artists. The idea is that the musicians apply to be in the show and the audience apply for tickets (although you\'ll almost always get them); the shows consist of three or four unsigned acts playing their original songs in unique venues around the city, from gin distilleries to volunteers\' homes, and even some of our very own Outpost members have played. Patrons sit on cushions and bring their own blankets to simply relax and enjoy the music, spending the night snug and warm without a reason to go outside. If you\'re lucky, try to snag a ticket for a BYOB session in one of the private residences which makes for the perfect night in (only \'out\') in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1>3. Explore an art gallery by night</h1>\r\n<p>Many of New York City&rsquo;s art galleries are so huge you could spend an entire day there. What you might not know is that you can spend an entire night there, too, on selected dates. Several galleries, including the <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guggenheim</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, have late night winter events where you can explore the art after work. The Guggenheim&rsquo;s \"<strong>Art After Dark</strong>\" events come with live entertainment, so you can sip on a drink and listen to a DJ while you appreciate the art, while the Met run drawing classes and other activities on their \"<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/met-fridays\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Met Fridays</a>,\" all of which you can enjoy while being wonderfully warm and cosy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"5 hot-spots for those cold NYC winter nights (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_16.jpg\" alt=\"5 hot-spots for those cold NYC winter nights (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo:&nbsp;Guggenheim</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">4.

Head to <strong>Food Gallery 32 </strong>for a wide range of home made Korean food or take a trip to <strong>Eataly</strong> for Italian cuisine you can even take home with you. If you&rsquo;re in the mood to stroll in a heated plaza, try <strong><a href=\"http://www.chelseamarket.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chelsea Market</a></strong>,&nbsp;known as a quintessential New York experience (where you can also shop), or the new <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/newyork/time-out-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Out Market</a> in DUMBO, which features some impressive views from its rooftop dining area while still not being within a reasonable budget.</span></p>\r\n<h1><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"5 hot-spots for those cold NYC winter nights (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/3_16.jpg\" alt=\"5 hot-spots for those cold NYC winter nights (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo:&nbsp;Abimelec G., Yelp</p>\r\n<h1>5. See a Broadway show</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter the weather, the show must go on, and Broadway is the perfect place to continue it. Spend your winter nights soaking up some culture in the warmth of one of Broadway&rsquo;s historic theatres. Although prices are normally high, if you use trusted partners like <strong>TodayTix</strong> or line up on the morning of the performance for \"<strong>Rush Tickets</strong>\"&nbsp;you can find some unexpected bargains.</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', '1_6.jpg', 1, '2019-10-30 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

You can expect them to wipe down surfaces in the kitchen and dining areas, mop the floor of the common areas, make sure the bathroom is scrubbed and restocked with toilet paper, and other essential tasks. They will also clean the floors of your room if you leave the door open to signal it is alright to do so.</p>\r\n<h1>What you can\'t expect the cleaners to do...</h1>\r\n<h1>1)&nbsp;\"Everything\"</h1>\r\n<p>Okay, it sounds obvious, but you\'d be surprised how many people get the wrong end of the stick here.&nbsp;One of the benefits of coliving at Outpost is that everything is included, including our in-house cleaners, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that you should always try to keep things clean in between visits, as far as your personal property (and dish usage) is concerned.</p>\r\n<h1>2)&nbsp;Keep things spotless in between cleanings</h1>\r\n<p>If you want to live in a tidy house (and we hope you do!), some of the cleaning will have to happen on your end. It seems simple really, but cleaning up as you go is the best way to avoid roommate arguments and keep harmony in the coliving space. Although we have regular cleaners, mess can build up quickly, so it isn&rsquo;t realistic to leave things like dishes and personal belongings in between cleaning sessions (and it shouldn&rsquo;t be the cleaners&rsquo; responsibility to deal with personal items such as dishes). Coliving is all about sharing, and sometimes that means sharing the chores as well as the fun.</p>\r\n<p>Even though you might be in a rush in the morning before work, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t clean up when you get home at night, and it&rsquo;s a lot easier doing it in small bursts than all at once. Cleaning up in small ways like doing your dishes, filling up and emptying the dishwasher and wiping down surfaces in between cleaners&rsquo; visits makes all the difference to the happiness of your fellow roommates.</p>\r\n<h1><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Top tips for cleaning in a coliving space (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_7.jpg\" alt=\"Top tips for cleaning in a coliving space (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />3)&nbsp;Keep your room clean</h1>\r\n<p>It is your room, after all, and although the cleaners will of course help you out with regular cleanings, it\'s important to keep things clean in between visits. If you&rsquo;re sharing a room, you might find that it&rsquo;s sometimes a challenge to keep things clean. The best way is to keep your own part of the room clean and avoid unnecessary mess caused by eating in your room or not putting clothes back in the closet. And when cleaning day rolls around, simply leave your door open to signal to the cleaners it&rsquo;s alright to come in and make sure that all clothes and other obstructive objects are off the floor so they can clean your room easily and efficiently.</p>', '2_1.jpg', 1, '2019-10-18 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

The co-founders travelled to Santa Elena where they sponsored art activities and got to know the community and local farmers through communal events. It&rsquo;s these same people who 3-19 now source their coffee from. 3-19 ensures that the communities they buy their coffee from always benefit economically, socially and environmentally, even setting aside a portion of their profits for social projects in the communities where they work.

If you&rsquo;ve decided to live in a shared space, here are some tips to make day-to-day life run smoothly.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Be upfront and honest with your roommates</strong></h1>\r\n<p>The risk of living with roommates as an introvert is that they might think you&rsquo;re being rude by not wanting to hang out with them all the time, so dodge this bullet by explaining to them that you&rsquo;re an introvert. You can be as detailed as you like, saying that you like to hang out occasionally but need some time to yourself, or if you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable going into it, just explain that you have a stressful job/ school work and you&rsquo;re sorry if you don&rsquo;t have time to hang out as much as they might want to. As long as you explain it politely, they\'ll understand.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Living with roommates as an introvert (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_17.jpg\" alt=\"Living with roommates as an introvert (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Find you own sense of privacy</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few tricks to getting alone-time in a shared apartment. If you have your own room, it&rsquo;s not too much of an issue. Simply part ways with your roommates with a smile (and if they ask, you can say you&rsquo;ve got a Netflix show to binge). In shared rooms this may seem harder, but little things like wearing headphones (you don&rsquo;t even need to be listening to music) send a polite signal that you&rsquo;re not available to talk. You can even have a discussion with your roommates and ask if it&rsquo;s alright not to talk in the bedroom itself. If you have a bunk bed, try&nbsp;draping a throw over the railings to&nbsp;give yourself instant privacy without seeming rude.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Time your recharging time wisely</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timing can be important when finding your chance to recharge in a shared living space. Get to know your roommates&rsquo; schedules and work your me-time around it, whether that means getting up earlier than your roommates or staying up later, or making sure you fit your cooking time into the time slot when nobody is home. If you live in an Outpost house, remember your space is not just the apartment itself. Explore the TV room, backyard or rooftop at different times of day, as these spaces are often free on certain days like weekdays.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Living with roommates as an introvert (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_18.jpg\" alt=\"Living with roommates as an introvert (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Be friendly when you do see your roommates</strong></h1>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re roommates aren&rsquo;t going to see you very often, you might as well try to make the times they do see you pleasant. Tiny things like smiling on your way to the shower can make a big difference to&nbsp;maintaining roommate harmony when you might not want to hang out with them every day. You can also show friendliness through other, non-social acts. If you have time, making coffee for your roommates in the morning or baking cookies for everyone on your day off sends a welcoming signal&nbsp;without having to engage in social interactions (and everyone loves a little hand-written note when it&rsquo;s not passive aggressive).</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Find a sacred space</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding a space outside the home can be a great way to recharge. This space can act as an oasis when you&rsquo;re overwhelmed by people, allowing you uninterrupted me-time. Whether it&rsquo;s a local coffee-shop, park or even a mall you like to wander around, there&rsquo;s always somewhere quiet to be found in the throng of a city. Take a stroll around your neighborhood or Google \"quiet spaces\" in the area for inspiration.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Living with roommates as an introvert (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_11.jpg\" alt=\"Living with roommates as an introvert (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Jump into socializing occasionally</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can, it&rsquo;s better to socialize with your roommates occasionally. For one thing, once you know people hanging out with them will drain you slightly less as you\'ll be more comfortable. It&rsquo;s also good to get outside of your comfort zone every now and again. This might mean setting a weekly \"date night\" for a group dinner or a movie or, if you live at Outpost, going along to one of our regular social events. Just remember that going along to an event or even hanging out in your apartment doesn&rsquo;t stop you leaving early and&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll still be proud of yourself for giving it a go.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The benefits of <a href=\"../coliving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">coliving</a> are universal, but selecting a roommate carefully is important. The main source of human emotions and perceptions is spending time with lovely people. As a result, everything is directly dependent on you, and the Outpost Club will take care of your housing.</p>', '1_7.jpg', 1, '2019-11-04 06:00:00', '2022-11-01 07:17:47', NULL, 0, 0),

They help you get your arms around a&nbsp;new city</h3>\r\n<p>If you\'re <a href=\"../nyc-rooms-for-rent\" target=\"_blank\">new to a city</a>, roommates are the answer to several of those newbie problems. First, they help you tick off the problem of not knowing anyone. Reach out to your roommates and smile and you\'ll probably find the favor returned to you. If they\'ve lived in the city for a while, they can be a good source of insider knowledge from everything from how to order a local ID to which grocery store is the cheapest, or if they\'re new like you you can spend time exploring the city together and making new memories.</p>\r\n<h3><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why everyone in their 20s should try living with roommates (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_16.jpg\" alt=\"Why everyone in their 20s should try living with roommates (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />2. They can save you money</h3>\r\n<p>Most people know it\'s cheaper to live with roommates. High rents in cities means it\'s much more affordable to share spaces, and in co-living apartments like Outpost you can both save money and have more overall space by living with roomates, thanks to the communal backyards, rooftops and common rooms many of our houses offer. What you might not think about is how all the little things you share with roommates can add up to save you money: cooking potluck dinners, sharing a pizza on movie night and sharing other goods like blenders and tupperware can all add up. In a traditional living environment, you\'ll also share on bills, toilet paper and other add-ons by splitting the costs, but thankfully at Outpost that\'s all included in our flat fee.</p>\r\n<h3>3. They can broaden your horizons</h3>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why everyone in their 20s should try living with roommates (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_17.jpg\" alt=\"Why everyone in their 20s should try living with roommates (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Moving in with roommates (especially strangers) is essentially throwing yourself into a new, alien situation. That might sound scary but it\'s great for personal growth. By living with people you\'ll get to meet both them and their friends, opening yourself up to things and ideas that you may not have come across otherwise. If your roommate is a professional rock climber you might become an expert on rock climbing. Or if you\'re lucky enough to live with a film or television young professional, you might end up at a premier. Anything could happen when you decide to live with new people.</p>\r\n<h3>4. They teach you to be considerate</h3>\r\n<p>When you live on your own, you\'re the only one you have to take care of, but really life in the broader sense includes a good deal of&nbsp;consideration and sharing. Living with roommates can teach you consideration&nbsp;because you know that other people share&nbsp;the space at the same time as you. That means you shouldn\'t leave your dishes for days on end or leave the bathroom or the backyard in a mess. You also don\'t bring friends home at late hours of night or talk outside someone else\'s door because, well, you\'re a nice person, and it\'s better that way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>5. They\'re a shoulder to cry on</h3>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Why everyone in their 20s should try living with roommates (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/christie-kim-yxXk-sAn1BM-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Why everyone in their 20s should try living with roommates (Image-4)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Moving to a new city is tough. Starting a new job is tough. Actually, most things you\'ll do in your twenties will be tough, but also equally amazing and character building. Roommates mean there will always be someone to come home to to laugh or cry about your day. You can share the highs and the lows with them and hopefully come out with some life-long friends&nbsp;who can handle your worst and still deserve you at your best.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The beginning of a career growth process can be challenging and uncertain. You will face this problem on your own since you don\'t have anyone to turn to for assistance. Every young person must go through the stage of <a href=\"../coliving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">coliving</a>, and the Outpost Club\'s job is to make sure your future apartment has the greatest possible conditions.</p>', '2_4.jpg', 1, '2019-11-08 06:00:00', '2022-11-01 07:44:51', NULL, 0, 0),

Serving up fast (vegan) food in a calm, bright environment, it&rsquo;s the perfect place to grab a quick lunch or a hangover treat. With decadent options like burgers, crinkle fries and thick vegan shakes, as well as healthier choices like salads and grilled sandwiches, it&rsquo;s up to you how indulgent&nbsp;you want to be. We love the crispy chicken burger (vegan of course), which has a patty more convincingly meaty than McDonalds&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n<h1>2. Nourish Cafe</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nourish Cafe lives up to its name: everything here is about health and vitality (both your own and the planet&rsquo;s), serving up the best vegan food with a conscience. They pride themselves on only using organic, plant-based ingredients, which are all totally GMO free. The menu includes brunch favorites like avocado toast and quinoa waffles with hazelnut spread, as well as every day treats like the banh mi sandwich and the ever-popular Nourish bowl. The space is bright with large windows and plenty of white and pine wood, but with only 6 tables total it&rsquo;s better to go at off-peak times to guarantee a place to sit.</span></p>\r\n<h1><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"The 5 best vegan cafes in San Francisco (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_25.jpg\" alt=\"The 5 best vegan cafes in San Francisco (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo: <em>Nourish Cafe</em></p>\r\n<h1>3.

They even make their own chai from scratch every morning, with ginger, lemongrass, cinnamon, black tea and whole milk, and they&rsquo;re smoothie selection is almost endless. Choose from healthy ingredients including ashwaganda, maca, spirulina and more, blended with fruit, veggies and their signature homemade almond milk for the perfect vegan treat.</span></p>\r\n<h1>4. Greens&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Greens is one of our favorite vegan restaurants in the city partly because of its amazing view: this vegetarian and vegan haven sits on a gorgeous location overlooking the San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. Proudly at the forefront of the farm to table movement for over 35 years, this hidden gem serves both healthy and wholesome food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We love the black bean chili and the spring thai red curry, both made from the freshest ingredients from a Zen farm in Marin, and they&rsquo;re happy to make any vegetarian dish on the menu vegan if you ask with a smile.</span></p>\r\n<h1><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"The 5 best vegan cafes in San Francisco (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_15.jpg\" alt=\"The 5 best vegan cafes in San Francisco (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo: <em>Greens</em></p>\r\n<h1>5.

Avoid scams</h1>\r\n<p>It might go without saying, but apartment scams are often not as obvious as you think. Sites like Craigslist have a bad reputation, but they\'re not necessarily filled with scams. Red flags are more in the details; avoid apartment listings without photos or with photos which look doctored; ask to see the apartment before you put any money down (or ask for a video tour if you\'re overseas) and always trust your instincts. If something seems off, it\'s better to be safe than sorry. Asking for any money or personal details (aside from your favorite hobbies) before you\'ve seen the place is usually a scam alert.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>2. Google search and map the neighborhood safety</h1>\r\n<p>Just because a neighborhood is a good commute or a cheap price doesn\'t mean it\'s the right one for your home. You can get to know if a neighborhood is safe without living there with the help of Google. Type in the neighborhood you\'re thinking of moving to alongside keywords like \'safety\' or go straight to the crime statistics. Be aware of the date of articles you come across; many neighborhoods in big cities have seen big changes over the last few years and often previously crime-ridden areas are now perfectly safe to live in. If you want up to date information, try Google crime maps (you can see the NYC crime map <a href=\"https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) where you can see recommendations based on current statistics.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"5 tips for apartment hunting in a big city (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_35.jpg\" alt=\"5 tips for apartment hunting in a big city (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo: <em><a href=\"https://artsclubnyc.com/events/bushwick-street-art-tour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ArtsClub</a></em></p>\r\n<h1>3. Check there are things to see and do locally</h1>\r\n<p>You probably want to know that there are things to see and do in your new neighborhood; search&nbsp;\'bars\', \'restaurants\' or \'cafes in\' (your neighborhood name) and look at the number of pins. One great spot can make your experience of living in an apartment, so remember that quality sometimes beats quantity. You can also check out local blogs and housing blogs, like our articles on the appeal of living in different <a href=\"../nyc-rooms-for-rent\" target=\"_blank\">NYC neighborhoods</a>.</p>\r\n<h1>4. Don\'t forget the little details</h1>\r\n<p>Think about your typical week and what you might want from an apartment and neighborhood. Little things count; like what is the bus service like if the subway stops running? Can you get home at 3am in the morning, or are there city bikes nearby to shorten your commute? If you want to get the vibe of a neighborhood but can\'t go and visit, take a strong along Google street view within a few blocks\' radius.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"5 tips for apartment hunting in a big city (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_37.jpg\" alt=\"5 tips for apartment hunting in a big city (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo: <a href=\"https://sf.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SF.Gov</a></p>\r\n<h1>5. Go with a trusted source</h1>\r\n<p>We\'re not saying you have to rent through a company, but it\'s better if you do. Renting through an individual simply doesn\'t offer the renter the same rights and protection. At Outpost, for instance, you can see our track record, reviews and our transparent house rules and promises to our members. You can see evidence of happy members, past and present, on our social media and blog post. This type of information indicates that you can trust us and, although apartment sources come in all shapes and sizes, it\'s still something to keep in mind when decided whether to trust an individual or a company with your money.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '1_14.jpg', 1, '2019-11-25 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Look out the window or take a walk down a new street. It&rsquo;s an amazing thing to travel and to live abroad; every day you have the opportunity to meet new people and see new things. And the people around you might not be family, but friends are the family you choose for yourself. Christmas is just one day, so when you weigh it up against all the positives of your current adventure, it doesn&rsquo;t seem so bad to be where you are.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Connect with other people in the same situation</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;re living somewhere like Outpost, there will be lots of other people in the same situation as you. Ask around in the weeks leading up to Christmas and arrange something to do on the day like secret Santa or a Christmas party. You could even cook a whole Christmas meal with everyone bringing something, which is a great way to exchange cultures and explore what other people usually eat and drink on Christmas.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img title=\"Spending Christmas Away From Home: Top Tips (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/freestocks-org--Qf9JKLysUg-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Spending Christmas Away From Home: Top Tips (Image-2)\" /></span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Explore the local cultures</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every city has its own version of holiday celebrations.

Look up listings websites to see what&rsquo;s going on in your city, where you&rsquo;ll find everything from ice rinks to carol singing to soup kitchen volunteering. For instance, New York is famous for its beautiful Christmas displays along Fifth Avenue and in Dyker Heights.

It will define and debate the boundaries of intelligence and the line between human and machine and how different understandings of thinking itself can lead to different definitions of problems.</span></p>\r\n<h1>4.

You can also utilise the space under your bed by using storage boxes.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s best to store your suitcases under your bed, but suitcases can be more than just empty space. They can also be a place to store off-season clothes or other items you don&rsquo;t use very often, freeing up space in your room for other, less cluttered items.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Don&rsquo;t bring or buy anything you don&rsquo;t really need</strong></h1>\r\n<p><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How to live clutter-free in a shared room (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_37.jpg\" alt=\"How to live clutter-free in a shared room (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you arrive, you can minimize clutter by not bringing anything that&rsquo;s not truly necessary. If you&rsquo;re only staying in your shared room for a short amount of time, leave knick knacks and appliances at home. At co-living spaces such as Outpost, everything is included, so only clothes and toiletries are needed.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve moved in, simple resist the urge to shop too much. Many co-livers create a rule where they get rid of one old item for every new item bought, which means you won&rsquo;t end up accumulating a load of clutter. You can also mail items home or donate unwanted clothes or books to charity once you&rsquo;re no longer using them.</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', '3_7.jpg', 1, '2019-12-31 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

But unfortunately, it’s not that simple. ', '<p>With a population of over 8 million people, you might think it&rsquo;s easy to meet people in New York.

But unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not that simple.&nbsp;Urban isolation and loneliness is a growing issue in the United States. According to a 2018 survey, more than two in ten adults in the US (22%) say they always or often feel lonely, lack companionship, or feel left out or isolated, and a recent Cigna survey revealed over half of Americans (54%) said they always or sometimes feel that no one knows them well. That&rsquo;s pretty sad.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_39.jpg\" alt=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, former US Surgeon General <strong>Dr. Vivek Murthy</strong> says that loneliness can lead to increased risks of a whole host of mental and physical diseases and is as damaging as smoking fifteen cigarettes a day. So although you might not find yourself wanting to rent a cat or a cuddle to cheer yourself up on those long winter nights (which is the new trend in Tokyo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/07/loneliest-city-in-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">&lsquo;</a>affection industries<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/07/loneliest-city-in-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">&rsquo;</a>), you might be struck by the loneliness of your move to the next new city.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_50.jpg\" alt=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>So, where is this problem coming from? Urban loneliness has most often been linked to living alone. And Manhattan has one of the highest percentages of people living alone in the world, with two-thirds&shy; of people living by themselves (the national average in 1920 used to be 5%). The hard part&nbsp;is that if you live on your own, most people in big cities&nbsp;already have a group of friends which can be impossible&nbsp;to break into. The majority of New Yorkers seem to have pre-existing high school, college or work friends who they see and interact with almost exclusively. Sure, it would be great if you can find other people who are new to the city, but where do you find them? And wouldn\'t you benefit from the knowhow of people who have lived there longer?</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/press-release-downtown-brooklyn-house-2.jpg\" alt=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-3)\" />You can meet someone at an event or a bar and hit it off but then never hear from them again because in a big city, there&rsquo;s no accountability. We all know how easy it is to avoid someone with 8 million other people floating around. Roommates seem like the answer, but more and more often you&rsquo;ll find descriptions on apartment sharing websites that say the roommates \"keep to themselves\" or are \"always out\" and are looking for other people to live with who won&rsquo;t \"disturb\" them.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the beautiful thing about coliving. At Outpost, we&rsquo;re upfront about our aim to build a community in our houses, and although members don&rsquo;t have to take part in anything if they don&rsquo;t feel like it, you know from the start that you&rsquo;re going to be living with other people who want to make new friends just like you.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/4th%20July-26.jpg\" alt=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-4)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Our range of events, communal spaces and co-working areas are all designed to tackle loneliness and get meaningful conversations flowing. Sociologist Eric Klinenberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/30/the-rise-of-solo-living\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote in 2012</a> that, &ldquo;research shows that it&rsquo;s the quality, not the quantity of social interactions that best predicts loneliness.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-5), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/Pride7.png\" alt=\"How coliving is combatting urban loneliness (Image-5)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>So if you&rsquo;re barely home, busy or introverted, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to be lonely. Whether you hang out in one of our communal areas, cook a potluck dinner with your roommates in the kitchen or simply catch your roommate before you both go to sleep, the opportunity to get talking in coliving is always there if you want it. With coliving there&rsquo;s always someone to come home to, have a beer or a pizza with, and moan about your day.</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', '2_10.jpg', 1, '2020-02-21 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Color theory tells us that yellow is a calming color, as almost every culture associates yellow with sunshine, happiness and warmth. Yellow is also the most visible color of the spectrum and the first color which the human eye processes on sight.

In fact, some parts of the city are even nicer to walk around in the winter. Here are our top 5 winter walks in NYC to get you moving.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Riverside Park</strong></h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img title=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_54.jpg\" alt=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />&nbsp;Photo: <em><a href=\"https://co.pinterest.com/pin/404479610256911733/?amp_client_id=CLIENT_ID(_)&amp;mweb_unauth_id=&amp;simplified=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucille Burns, Pinterest</a></em></p>\r\n<p>Riverside Park is a favorite with Columbia students, being located just a few blocks from the university&rsquo;s main campus. Cross the road and away from the buzzing Harlem streets and walk down the steps to a Mecca of green in the middle of the city. Because of its lowered ground level, Riverside Park is an instant breath of fresh air in its quiet serenity. The hill also acts as a wind blocker, so it barely feels like winter when you weave your way between the paths and the trees. As the name aptly suggests, Riverside Park is located along the side of the Hudson River, following the path of the river vertically down the side of Manhattan, which makes for the perfect winter river walk. The throngs of college students playing games on the grass and joggers running up and down the stretch of park gives this space a friendly, community feel which makes it one of our favorite winter walks in the city.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>2. The Little Red Lighthouse</strong></h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_41.jpg\" alt=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo: <em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ataferner/19585444958\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Axel Taferner, Flickr&nbsp;</a></em></p>\r\n<p>Take a trip up to Fort Washington Park&nbsp;to see NYC&rsquo;s famed Little Red Lighthouse, the only lighthouse in New York City. Despite its acclaim, this little treasure is always blissfully tourist-free because it&rsquo;s actually pretty hard to get to. It&rsquo;s certainly worth the journey, though, as the lighthouse is a piece of history, built in 1921&nbsp;and it comes with amazing city views down the Hudson&nbsp;River. There&rsquo;s also plenty to see in the area around the lighthouse, so you can bring a picnic and make a day of it. Take a train to 190th Street or Dyckman Street&nbsp;and walk around Fort Tyron Park, a city park built around and through ancient walls and bridges. You can even pop in on the Met Cloisters just around the corner, a beautiful ancient monetary which has been restored into a museum as one of the branches of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The lighthouse is just a short underpass and walk away, so you can take in the not-so-city air and enjoy the sparkling riverside views while getting some culture (and warming up) on the same trip.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>3. East River State Park and Domino Park</strong></h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_43.jpg\" alt=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo: <em><a href=\"https://archpaper.com/2017/04/domino-sugar-factory-site-public-waterfront/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Archpaper</a></em></p>\r\n<p>Located at the beginning of Brooklyn, by the Williamsburg Bridge&nbsp;and the East River is a peaceful walk along East River State Park and Domino Park. The views of Manhattan from this side of the river are truly special and if you go at sunset you&rsquo;ll catch the reddest skies with a blissful shortage of other people around, making this the perfect afternoon walk to brighten up your winter. East River State Park has its own beach where you can walk up to the river water and pose for pictures on the (stable) rocks at the water&rsquo;s edge. It&rsquo;s a great place to sit and contemplate life, as it feels as though there&rsquo;s nothing but nature between you and the skyline. After soaking up the sandy air, you can walk south along Domino Park, a waterside promenade with unbeatable views. There are always people jogging and playing in this under the radar park, as features like public fountains, a dog park and bocce ball make it a communal, weekend-focused space.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>4. John V. Lindsay East River Park</strong></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<img title=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/2_44.jpg\" alt=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-4)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo: <em><a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/east-river-park\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NYC Gov Parks</a></em></p>\r\n<p>We love this unsung park for a winter walk because you can just keep walking to your heart&rsquo;s desire. Beginning at the Williamsburg Bridge, this Manhattan waterside promenade allows you to walk north up the eastern side of Manhattan island for as long as your legs can take you. Our favorite part of this walk is the stretch beginning at the Williamsburg Bridge, because the paved walkway looks directly onto the river and there&rsquo;s barely anyone else around (except for a few joggers). Enjoy sprawling gardens and even a children&rsquo;s play area as you take in the feeling of being far outside of the city whilst still being just a few blocks from the bustling streets.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>5. Battery Park</strong></h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-5), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_55.jpg\" alt=\"5 Winter Walks to try in NYC (Image-5)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo: <em><a href=\"https://www.nycgo.com/boroughs-neighborhoods/manhattan/battery-park-city\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NYC Go&nbsp;</a></em></p>\r\n<p>Battery Park is hidden at the base of Manhattan island, between the offices of Wall Street and the hustle bustle of the city. Somehow, though, it&rsquo;s one of the most peaceful places in Manhattan, and one of our favorites for a chilly winter stroll. The park has amply green space as well as a riverside promenade where you can take in the sights of New Jersey and, amazingly, catch clear sight of the Statue of Liberty, which at night lights up to give the park a magical feel. There are park benches dotted along the path with enclaves for fountains and other monuments, as well as several cafes and the famous Brookfield Place mall, the perfect place to shelter for a hot chocolate, meal or shopping trip after your walk.</p>', '1_17.jpg', 1, '2020-01-25 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

It&rsquo;s one of the few remaining night illuminated parades in North America and the biggest parade for the occasion outside of Asia, dating all the way back to the 1860s. Over 100 floats, dancers and other units are taking part in this giant celebration of Chinese culture and the crowds are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands.</p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll even get to see the newly crowned Miss Chinatown U.S.A take her pride of place and the spectacular 288&rsquo; Golden Dragon (carried by a team of 180 people). The parade, celebrating the incoming year of the rat, starts around 5pm on Saturday, February 8, stepping off at Second and Market Streets and finishing at 9pm.

If you&rsquo;re one of the many, many people in isolation getting doughy for the first time, you may have run into one of two problems: shortages of ingredients in your local grocery store or shortages in your ability to make your creations look the way they do in the recipe books&mdash;here are our baking hacks to fix both.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>1. Problem: The grocery store is out of flour</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Make your own</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Did you know that you can make your own (gluten-free!) oat flour using just oats and a blender?&nbsp; Simply blend gluten-free oats until they&rsquo;re powdered (it&rsquo;s that easy!)</p>\r\n<h1><strong>2. Problem: I don&rsquo;t have a rolling pin</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Use a wine bottle!</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may not have a rolling pin at home, but we bet you have wine! Wine bottles are the perfect alternative to rolling pins. Just cover your dough in plastic wrap and hold either end of the bottle, rolling to your heart&rsquo;s content.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>3. Problem: The grocery store is out of buttermilk</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Make your own</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many recipes use buttermilk for that extra flavor (especially pancakes!), but did you know you can make your own by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to every cup you use of regular milk. Let it sit for five minutes and you&rsquo;ve got buttermilk!</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>4. Problem: I can&rsquo;t mix in the butter properly</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Grate it</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be hard to get butter to soften and then to spread evenly throughout your mixture. For best results, grate the butter with a cheese grater to break it down into smaller chunks. This will mean the butter spreads, mixes and melts more easily.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>5. Problem: The grocery store is out of cookie dough</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Modify cake mix</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know you can make cookie dough from almost any boxed cake mix? All you need to do is add &frac12; cup of oil and 2 eggs to the dry milk then simply bake as you would regular cookie dough. Craving solved!</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>6. Problem: There are air bubbles in my cookies and cakes</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Bang the mixture</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you put your mixture in the oven, try dropping the pan of batter onto your countertop a few times. The force of the bang forces the air bubbles to the surface, meaning they won&rsquo;t get trapped in the batter and ruin the presentation of your creation. For cookies, it&rsquo;s best to do this after you take them out the oven to help them settle quicker.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>7. Problem: I don&rsquo;t have powdered sugar</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Make your own</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can even make your own powdered sugar perfect for frosting or icing without a trip to the grocery store. Just add 1 cup of white sugar and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and blend together until you reach a powdery texture.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>8. Problem: I dropped bits of eggshell in my batter</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Egg it out</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most frustrating things is accidentally dropping a bit of eggshell in your batter. You don&rsquo;t want to stick your fingers in the mixture and it can be tricky to get it to stay in one place. Instead, use the rest of the eggshell to fish the broken pieces out. The parts will gel together, making it easier to get hold of those pesky flakes and leaving your batter crunch-free.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>9. Problem: I can\'t cut my baking treats in a solid line</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Floss them or heat things up</strong></h1>\r\n<p>It can be hard to cut the perfect slice of that cake or to get your cookie dough to divide where you want it to. We\'ve got two solutions for this. Either whip out the dental floss and use this to cut a fine line to separate your mixture without any stickiness, as dental floss cuts cleanly without leaving any residue. Or why not try simply heating up your knife under hot water for a few seconds? Simply wipe it dry and take the knife straight to your creation to create solid, professional cuts.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>10. Problem: The grocery store is out of brown sugar</strong></h1>\r\n<h1><strong>Solution: Make your own</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Because everyone is baking in quarantine you might find that your grocery store is out of brown sugar. Don&rsquo;t panic! You can make your own using white sugar and molasses (which are available in most baking aisles!). For light brown sugar, mix one cup of granulated sugar with one tablespoon of molasses. For dark brown sugar, add two tablespoons of molasses. It&rsquo;s that simple. Just mix the two ingredients together with a fork until completely mixed. Crisis averted!</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', '2_15.jpg', 1, '2020-04-18 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

We\'ve put together a list of our favorite jazz bars to get you inspired and toe-tapping in no time.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Blue Note</strong></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Our favourite jazz bars in NYC (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_59.jpg\" alt=\"Our favourite jazz bars in NYC (Image-1)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></strong><em>Photo: Blue Note Jazz, Facebook</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue note tops the list of our favorite jazz clubs in the city because it simply never disappoints. A New York institution of music since 1981, this old school jazz bar will take you back to that &ldquo;old New York&rdquo; Sarah Jessica Parker has been telling you about for so long. The decor is dark, slick and anything but try-hard and the signed pictures on the wall of numerous jazz greats tell a story all of their own. The line up is always exceptional, with jazz legends and promising newcomers all gracing the blue-lit stage every day of the week. Prices vary based on the show you choose to see, but you can splurge to sit at a table (old school style) near the front or you can get a cheaper ticket that allows you to sit at the bar. It&rsquo;s definitely worth the price, however, because this place is a real music gem.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Smalls</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Our favourite jazz bars in NYC (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_61.jpg\" alt=\"Our favourite jazz bars in NYC (Image-2)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Photo: Smalls</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smalls is probably one of the most famous jazz clubs in the city. Tucked away on West 10th Street, this underground cavern is always filled with the sweet rhythms of jazz and blues from some of the world&rsquo;s best musicians. It&rsquo;s the perfect place if quality is your only factor in a good night, because the vibe is slightly lacking for us (it&rsquo;s on the stuffier side of the jazz spectrum). The place is so small that patrons are often given a ticket to come back at a designated slot. The ticket gets you into </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mezzrow</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> across the street, which we argue is a destination in itself. Mezzrow is intimate and classy but without the high ticket prices of Smalls, and although you won&rsquo;t get the same consistent line-up of famous musicians, this is where many of the best cats come to practice and find their feet.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Fat Cat</strong></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Our favourite jazz bars in NYC (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_60.jpg\" alt=\"Our favourite jazz bars in NYC (Image-3)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo: <em>Nez B., Yelp</em></p>\r\n<p>Fat Cat is a perfect introduction to jazz for those of you who don&rsquo;t want to jump in at the deep end. Sure, it&rsquo;s not as serious or high calibre as the other options here, but it&rsquo;s one of the most fun places to spend an evening in the city. Jazz plays in the background while you can enjoy a range of games, including ping pong and boardgames. The whole combination of music, beer and friendly vibes makes for a great Friday night hangout at a reasonable price while still being able to catch that iconic New York jazz.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>The Nest</strong></h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Our favourite jazz bars in NYC (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/1_62.jpg\" alt=\"Our favourite jazz bars in NYC (Image-4)\" width=\"\" height=\"\" />Photo: <em>The Nest, Facebook&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nest, Brooklyn, describes itself as &lsquo;an everything venue&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s the jazz shows that really stand out at this hidden gem of a bar. Located in the heart of Flatbush, the music at the Nest is that old school, grimy jazz that feels authentic to the bone. The atmosphere of the basement show room is relaxed, with dark, moody lighting and cheap drinks. This is the epitome of where jazz is today, without the feel of commercialisation that some other jazz bars have.</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', '1_19.jpg', 1, '2020-02-07 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

With modern technology, there are plenty of ways you can stay in contact with loved ones and maintain social contact with the outside while staying safely indoors.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>1.&nbsp;Use video chat or a phone call</strong></h1>\r\n<p>The most simple of these options is to pick up the phone, sharing either your audio or your audio and video with your loved ones via apps such as <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204380\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facetime</a>, <a href=\"http://skype.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skype</a> or <a href=\"zoom.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zoom</a>. Just seeing a human face, even if not in person, can be enough to make you feel socially connected to the world again.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>2. Work on a creative project with others</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Usually, we socialize through activities. There&rsquo;s no reason that social distancing has to be any different. Working (remotely) on a creative project with friends, family or even likeminded strangers you connect with over the internet is the perfect way to stay socially connected, especially as collaboration is closely related to making us feel connected to others.</p>\r\n<p>So why not ask a friend if they want to write one line of a short story each a day, or write a song together on video chat where you play the guitar while they sing. The possibilities are endless and you&rsquo;ll have the added bonus of having a unique piece of art at the end of this all which will be a living diary to your struggles (or joy) in isolation.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>3. Go to a (virtual) social event with others</strong></h1>\r\n<p>The amount of online social events popping up on social media right now is astounding. Whether you pre-plan to attend virtually with a friend or tune in solo, you can enjoy concerts from home as well as video chat parties run by your regular NYC nightlife hangouts and much, much more. The app Houseparty takes video chat to the next level allows you to play games and interact with your friends in new and exciting ways, whilst online bar* has cropped up as a free space to grab a drink and meet new or existing friends in a virtual setting.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>4. Exercise with others</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Whether you normally engage in exercise classes or just want to try something new, video chat exercise classes are a great way to get your daily dose of social contact with others over the internet. Many local NYC fitness trainers are currently advertising live online exercise classes at varying times (check their <a href=\"http://instagram.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> pages; we love the daily 8am group workout by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlinkFitness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blink Fitness</a>), or if you fancy a smaller group you can coordinate to watch the same fitness video with a group of friends and simply turn on your video chat to feel as though you&rsquo;re exercising together, despite being physically apart.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>5. Try co-working</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Many people won&rsquo;t have much free time during this period of social distancing, as working from home brings its own challenges. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to miss out on social contact. Arrange a time to co-work with members of your household where you sit together in near-silence or have allotted times in which you can speak and where you can work; this will ensure that you get your work done while still getting social contact.</p>\r\n<p>The same activity can be replicated on video chat; pre-arrange to co-work with a friend and video chat them, putting the camera to one side while you both work and you&rsquo;ll see how much more social you feel when you trick your brain into thinking someone else is in the room. This can even help productivity, as miniature breaks to socialize while still getting on with work will help you maintain focus and positivity in these tricky times.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '9.jpg', 1, '2020-03-25 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

It&rsquo;s easy in this situation to proclaim yourself bored and turn to Netflix or napping, but there are more positive ways to pass the time that are actually fun. Check out our recommendations below.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Learn a language.</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is a great opportunity to learn that language you&rsquo;ve been wanting to for years. The intense time at home will give you the chance to prepare and look forward to a time in future when you can visit this country (because this will be over one day!). There are plenty of free online sources and apps which teach language skills. We love </span><a href=\"http://www.babbel.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Babbel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://www.duolingo.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duolingo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which can both be worked into your daily routine in small and regular doses.</span></p>\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp;Broaden your mind.</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a whole host of online platforms offering free courses to educate yourself during this period of isolation. We love </span><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a digital platform offering classes and qualifications at all levels, including </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yale&rsquo;s </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-quarantine-yale-university-classes-free-online/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most popular class</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for free. Or why not take classes from leading figures in your chosen area with </span><a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Masterclass</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? New York&rsquo;s </span><a href=\"https://writingclasses.com/classes/video?fbclid=IwAR0fEt3RhenCNR1K5Wt_nuFVlBcEtBjgzPAnfYe-h054ASzmhwEIjZV-clo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gotham Writers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has also switched to online classes, teaching everything from novel writing to business writing.</span></p>\r\n<h3>3. Take up or develop a hobby.</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, this time can be used to develop or pick up a new skill. Don&rsquo;t have any hobbies? No problem, it&rsquo;s not too late to start.&nbsp; Ever wanted to play an instrument? Now&rsquo;s the perfect time, with online </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP1ZfPYU0cjhXXnuxlLVhqQ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guitar lessons</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and many more available across the web.</span></p>\r\n<h3>4. Get some culture from home.</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because you&rsquo;re at home doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t get some culture in your spare time. In fact, the global lockdown is seeing many cultural institutions offering more services for free than ever before. The </span><a href=\"http://www.metopera.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metropolitan Opera</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is streaming live performances </span><a href=\"https://www.metopera.org/user-information/coronavirus-updates/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every day at 7:30 p.m. ET</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and local NYC institutions such as </span><a href=\"https://www.bowerypoetry.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bowery Poetry</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are holding regular live readings over social media platforms.</span></p>\r\n<h3>5. Catch up with friends (virtually).</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first time in probably a long time, all your friends in many different countries are going to be at home with (probably) flexible schedules. Take this opportunity to reconnect (virtually) with your friends. This will both lift your mood and strengthen your friendships, making something positive out of this bad situation! Remember that you&rsquo;re not alone and everyone is struggling in their own way, so anything you can do to list the mood of others will be positive for all.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At first look, it may appear difficult to find intriguing things to do at home, but there are so many interesting things in the world that all you need is a desire. Now is the perfect time to <a href=\"../philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rent a room</a> at Outpost Club, so seize the opportunity!</p>', 'joel-muniz-XqXJJhK-c08-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2020-03-19 05:00:00', '2022-11-01 07:36:40', NULL, 0, 0),

But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way. With a focus on your body, mind and soul you can come out the other end of this even healthier than when you entered.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Your body</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With some forward planning, it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to keep your body healthy during quarantine. Of course, the combination of diet and exercise is the key here, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to restrict yourself. In terms of diet, the key is getting your daily vitamins. Make sure you get at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day and remember, the more colors on your plate, the better, because that means that you&rsquo;re getting a good spread across vitamins. You might also want to take a vitamin supplement during this period, as unfortunately your sun intake is likely to be limited by&nbsp;spending most of the day indoors. And don&rsquo;t worry about snacking left right and centre, that&rsquo;s totally normal in such anxious times, just be sure to snack on healthy foods like carrot sticks, nuts or other veggies if you can.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to exercise, some is always better than none at all. There are plenty of HIIT workouts, yoga classes and other videos available on Youtube. It can be difficult to motivate yourself in times such as this, which is why local NYC gyms such as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlinkFitness/?ref=search&amp;s_tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARAHcR3nnYfMIGOBqHjYREw_MhxUl4arRZfBxT03eqiujlGcGMKWJTZyY1dTojS9bvq_BkInm7P2n6Qt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blink Fitness</a>&nbsp;have started regular free group training sessions so you can feel connected to others from the comfort of your own home. If you&rsquo;re not a gym bunny, this can all seem a bit overwhelming, but simply throwing on your headphones and blaring Whitney Houston in your ears while you dance like crazy around the room is also exercise (and let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s pretty darn fun)--so get creative with your exercise and go easy on the self-judgment.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Your mind</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need to both&nbsp;contract and relax your mind like a muscle to keep it healthy. To keep yourself thinking straight, it&rsquo;s important to have a focus, whether that&rsquo;s work or if you&rsquo;re not currently working, then some other way to stretch your mind, such as learning a new skill or reading. The <a href=\"http://nypl.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York Public Library</a>&nbsp;allows&nbsp;New Yorkers to sign up for a library card online and you can start borrowing ebooks right away. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But don&rsquo;t put too much pressure on yourself to be productive during quarantine. You&rsquo;ve also got to let your mind relax during this trying time. Try d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oing something fun which has been on your bucket list, like watching that list of best movies of all time or downloading The Sims in classic 90s nostalgia. Now more than ever is the time to indulge in your guilty pleasures--no one will ever know if you watch Disney on repeat or learn all the words to Eminem&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lose Yourself&rdquo; with this time! It&rsquo;s also good to keep in contact with at least a small number of friends or family during quarantine; although you can&rsquo;t spend your whole day replying to everyone, the human contact you get from video calling or simply texting others will give your mental health a boost&nbsp;in these trying times.</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Your soul</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s also key to keep your soul healthy during quarantine. Self-care is an underrated part of keeping ourselves healthy and now is the perfect time to fix that. Self-care means looking after yourself just as you would a friend, instead of beating yourself up, setting unrealistically high expectations of yourself or just generally being mean to yourself. If you wouldn\'t do it to a friend, don\'t do it to yourself. Knowing your worth and that you are loved by others is easier said than done, of course, but you can take simple steps towards wellbeing through self-care practices such as engaging in a favorite hobby (even when you have a work deadline!), turning your phone off when you&rsquo;re stressed, treating yourself in whatever way works best for you (think facemasks, your favourite desserts, or buying that top on <a href=\"http://www.asos.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ASOS</a> you&rsquo;ve been staring at since the beginning of quarantine!)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some people, spiritual activities such as yoga can be beneficial for your wellbeing, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to do it that way if the \"traditional\" forms of self-care don\'t suit you. Self-care comes in many forms--even allowing yourself to cry can be healing. The important thing is to look inside yourself and think deeply about what you need to feel good during quarantine and to do it without feelings of guilt. And remember, being healthy on the outside comes from within.</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>', 'ways-to-stay-healthy-at-home.jpg', 1, '2020-03-23 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0);

You can even step virtually into the museum itself, with the ability to explore the interior of the gallery via Street View.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong><strong>MoMa, NYC</strong></strong></h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York&rsquo;s </span><a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/moma-the-museum-of-modern-art?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Museum of Modern Art</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has a page on Google Arts and Culture, too. Founded in 1929, The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) was the first museum devoted to the modern era, offering a varied collection spanning modern and contemporary art, with over 150,000 paintings, scultures, drawings, prints, photographs, architectural models and drawings as well as today\'s film and performance art. You can find everything from Monet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Water Lilies&rdquo; to Picasso&rsquo;s &ldquo;Les Demoiselles d\'Avignon&rdquo; to works by Andy Warhol in this celebrated museum, which you can now access online. On Google Arts and Culture, MoMa is currently holding the free online exhibit on Sophie Taeuber-Arp as well as several paid exhibits and events, plus you can explore a range of digital collections, including those on &ldquo;Installation art&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sculpture.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong><strong>Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay, Paris</strong></strong></h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/musee-dorsay-paris?hl=en\">Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay</a> is one of Paris&rsquo; leading art galleries, built for the Universal Exhibition of 1900 in the former Orsay railway station. This impressive museum displays art from 1848 to 1914, so why not browse their online collections and walk the halls themselves (virtually) through the &ldquo;museum view&rdquo; feature and digital collections available on Google Arts and Culture? The online exhibit, \"From Station to the Renovated Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Orsay\", will educate you on the history of the museum while the extensive image collections will broaden your mind with everything from oil paint to canvas to Impressionism collections on display.</p>\r\n<h1><strong><strong>National Gallery, London</strong></strong></h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>London&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/the-national-gallery-london?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Gallery</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is home to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over 2,300 artworks, with paintings from all major traditions of Westwern Europe from late medieval artists to those of Renaissance Italy to the French Impressionists. Their collections also include many famous works, such as van Eyck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arnolfini Portrait,&rdquo; Turner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fighting Temeraire&rdquo; and Van Gogh&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sunflowers.&rdquo; Offering an incredible 12 online exhibitions at the moment, the current focus is on Monet, with exhibits including \"Monet\'s Rouen painting series\", \"Monet: The Water Lily Pond\" and \"Monet\'s Paris\" as well as a range of digital image collections spanning painting across oil, canvas and wood, which focus on the Renaissance.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many more museums and galleries to explore beyond this.

Between questionable Craigslist posts and all the little expenses we tend to forget, it can end up feeling impossible to find somewhere to live, period &mdash; let alone somewhere you&rsquo;ll be happy, with people you&rsquo;ll grow to love.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you do find somewhere that fits the bill, it can end up prohibitively expensive: Between high rents, security deposits and extra fees before you move in, and then buying furnishings and supplies once you&rsquo;re there, costs can rack up quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Outpost, though, everything is included in our flat fee, so you don\'t have to worry about utilities, WiFi, Netflix, household supplies or furnishings; all you have to bring is your suitcase. Making moving easy has always been a part of the Outpost ethos, but now we\'re taking it a step further. Here are three ways we\'re making moving to a major city more affordable than ever:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Skip your security deposit</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big reason moving is so expensive is because of security deposits! Whether you\'ll only be in the city for a few months or you don\'t know how long you\'ll be staying, you don\'t want to eat up a big chunk of your income with a security deposit you won\'t get back for months.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\'s why </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2K0FXPy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we\'ve partnered with HelloRented</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to offer zero security deposit for qualified tenants. Qualified members pay a small monthly fee during their time with Outpost Club and never need to think about tying up their funds with a security deposit, allowing them to save more for the future.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Get our lowest rates ever&nbsp;</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\'ve lowered our rates across New York City, Jersey City and San Francisco for new applicants, allowing you to find your new home without stressing about paying high prices as you navigate moving to a new city. Your rate applies for the length of time of your membership agreement, so you can lock in a lower rate now for the summer, when rent is traditionally at its highest.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking advantage of our new, lower rates, you&rsquo;ll be able to put more of your hard-earned money in savings to make sure you&rsquo;ll always be ready for whatever comes next.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Lock in a more flexible cancellation policy</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We understand that now, more than ever, life changes quickly &mdash; so we\'re not going to lock you into a contract with no way out. We\'ve revamped our cancellation policy for new membership agreements so you can cancel with no additional fees up until 7 days before your move-in date.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Outpost, we want to make moving in and getting started in a new city as easy as ordering a cup of coffee: All you have to do is </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2XuDAMT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submit your information here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and you can move in as soon as tomorrow. No hoops to jump through, no red tape, no surprises &mdash; just a new community and peace of mind.

So we\'ve swapped our stiff business clothes for comfortable sweats and can do our work from our couches. While there are benefits to working from home, the boundary between work life and personal life has faded &mdash; which can make a routine far more difficult to achieve. Here are our tips to stay productive, even from your living room!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Create a schedule</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you prefer to work your normal office hours or have shifted your day to a later time table, maintaining a schedule you can stick to is a great way to assure that you\'re not over-working or skimping on must-do tasks. One bonus of quarantine is that you\'re able to choose your own hours, just make sure it\'s a sustainable schedule!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Make an office space</h2>\r\n<p>No faster way to lose focus than working from under your blankets or while the TV blares in the background. Find an at-home office space that works for you and keep your supplies, computer and planner in one place, rather than letting your workspace extend all throughout your home. If you\'re able to have a somewhat private area for work that\'s even better &mdash; it will help you limit distractions to get through your work efficiently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Give yourself a break&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>In many office environments employees are given two 15-minute breaks in addition to an hour for lunch. While it can be easy to get sucked into the task at hand, giving yourself a breather and step away from the desk can clear your head and prevent burn out. Take a short walk, prepare a healthy lunch from home or do a stretching routine to break up your day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Transition in and out</h2>\r\n<p>Where we used to have our commute and early morning Starbucks run to mark the beginning of a workday, now we can just open our laptop. To create a better boundary between your work and personal life, create both a morning and evening routine to bookend your day. Even if you begin your workday at noon, having a \"morning\" routine before you clock in can be a better and more enjoyable way to kick off your day compared to a blaring alarm. Start strong with an at-home workout, freshly brewed cup of coffee or a hearty breakfast &mdash; whatever puts you in the best mood to begin WFH. You can finish off your day with a relaxing shower, healthy dinner or by heading outside for some sunshine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Socialize</h2>\r\n<p>While WFH, we miss out on the natural socializing we get in an office environment. Make a point to check in with your coworkers &mdash; whether it\'s about an upcoming project or how they\'re keeping busy. A quick Zoom call can break up the monotony of your day and we could all use a bit more social interaction while quarantined.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Tackle a to-do list</h2>\r\n<p>At the beginning of every workday, make a to-do list with the essential tasks. Avoid piling on too many items because it can result in burnout. Instead, stick with the projects you are sure you can do within work hours &mdash; once you\'ve completed the list you can always work on longer-term projects or check off a few tasks for the next day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Top photo credit: Thought Catalog</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'thought-catalog-505eectW54k-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2020-05-25 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

Most establishments require that customers wear one while inside and with parks bustling with activity it\'s always better safe than sorry.

Face masks reduce the risk of you infecting or becoming infected by someone with COVID-19.</p>\r\n<h3>Wash your hands</h3>\r\n<p>You might be tired of hearing this, but this recommendation is an essential step to preventing the spread of coronavirus into your communal home. After being outside, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, making sure to lather up on the backs of your hands and in-between your fingers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Keep it clean</h3>\r\n<p>After washing your hands, wipe down any surfaces you\'ve come into contact with while outside, including your phone, doorknobs, keys and water bottle. Contaminants can enter the house on you and your belongings, so regularly sanitizing your items will cut down any risk of exposure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Get outside</h3>\r\n<p>The likelihood of transmission is much lower if you opt for outdoor activities. Instead of meeting up with friends at their home, maintain social distancing and meet up at a park. With the summer months upon us, it\'s a great time to catch some sun and enjoy the outdoors post-quarantine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you\'re looking for more guidelines to keep yourself and housemates safe, check out the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/going-out.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">CDC\'s comprehensive recommendations</a> for every activity, from grocery store protocol to taking public transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo by Macau Photo Agency on Unsplash</p>', 'macau-photo-agency-ZtNIi7HiUQ8-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2020-06-29 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

This recipe only takes five minutes to mix up, but you will need a blender!</p>\r\n<h3>Cucumber Moscow Mule</h3>\r\n<p>There\'s nothing quite as refreshing and light as a Moscow mule, and this recipe has the cool summer addition of a cucumber twist. This drink is best served in a copper mug, topped with some fresh mint leaves and cucumber wheels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Kahlua Cold Brew Coffee Cocktail</h3>\r\n<p>The only thing better than a creamy cold brew coffee on a hot summer day is one made with Kahlua. You can garnish with chocolate syrup, whipped cream or a coffee syrup flavor of your choice.</p>\r\n<h3>Strawberry Mojito</h3>\r\n<p>If you love a minty mojito in the summer months, try out this strawberry mojito recipe to mix things up. You\'ll need a batch of simple syrup to perfect this recipe &mdash; we recommend making a container full to save in the fridge for coffee and other cocktail recipes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Grapefruit and Rosemary Gin Cocktail</h3>\r\n<p>Like a classic gin and tonic, but with a twist. It\'s sweet and slightly sour with the grapefruit and a perfect cocktail to share! Use fresh sprigs of rosemary to garnish your cocktail and make it look high-class.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Blackberry Pineapple Rum Cocktail</h3>\r\n<p>This delicious tropical cocktail is simple yet decadent. You\'ll need to make blackberry simple syrup to complete this cocktail &mdash; which can be easily added to other summer drink recipes for a fruity twist.</p>\r\n<h3>Dark and Stormy</h3>\r\n<p>A classic drink for good reason &mdash; this version is made with spiced rum which pairs well with crisp ginger beer. All you\'ll need is dark rum and ginger beer!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photo by kyryll ushakov on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'kyryll-ushakov-lwoTuByIuC4-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2020-06-22 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

While we\'re all for a luxurious face mask and home spa, self-care should also include daily habits that give you time to unwind. Here are a few ways you can practice self-care every day!</p>\r\n<h3>Write in a journal&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Sometimes we move at warp-speed, rarely taking the time to sit down and process our thoughts. Journaling can help you get in touch with your emotions, act as an outlet and provides a way to track progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Declutter your space</h3>\r\n<p>Cleaning might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of self-care, but having an organized space can make the rest of your day feel far more manageable. Put away your laundry, clear out the accumulated glasses and light a candle. Rather than causing you stress, your space can become a sanctuary where you can relax and unwind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Go outside</h3>\r\n<p>Spending time in nature and soaking up some sunshine is a foolproof way to fit self-care into your day. Whether you\'re biking to work, getting some exercise or reading a book, getting outside can help you clear your head and get some much-needed Vitamin D!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Grab a book</h3>\r\n<p>Whether you prefer motivational books or fiction, reading can inspire you and give you time away from your overflowing to-do list. Relax with a cup of tea or coffee and read a chapter every day (or more if you\'re a true book worm).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Unplug from social media</h3>\r\n<p>It can be hard to focus on yourself while scrolling endlessly through Instagram. Take some time each day to disconnect from social media and spend that time doing one of these self-care tasks without the distraction of a Twitter notification.</p>\r\n<h3>Get moving&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Even if you only have fifteen minutes to spare, doing a quick yoga flow or going on a walk can clear your head and allow you time to yourself. Jam out to your favorite playlist, focus on your breathing and tune into your body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@anthonytran?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Anthony Tran</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unsplash</a></em></p>', 'anthony-tran-8i2fHtStfxk-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2020-07-13 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

While some of the restaurants in the hall have temporarily closed, there are still plenty of spots to grab some grub and a cocktail before heading up to the rooftop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.230-fifth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">230 Fifth</a></h3>\r\n<p>Normally this rooftop destination is packed with people in search of a cocktail after their 9-5, but their socially distanced tables have made this location a much more relaxed space to unwind. We recommend checking out their brunch buffet, which runs 12:00-4:00 and offers dishes like Bailey\'s french toast and cheesy omelets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thecrownnyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Crown</a></h3>\r\n<p>For those that want a chill rooftop vibe, check out the Crown atop the Hotel 50 Bowery in the Lower East Side. Though their food menu is smaller than some other rooftop locations, their classic drinks made with high-quality ingredients and a stellar view of Manhattan make this spot worthy of a visit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.dearirving.com/dear-irving-on-hudson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dear Irving</a></h3>\r\n<p>With sweeping 360-degree views of Manhattan and an assortment of both classic and unique cocktails, Dear Irving is a high-class spot to sit back and admire the glory of New York City. Though admittedly one of the more expensive rooftops, the view makes it well worth the price tag.</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.azulrooftop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azul</a></h3>\r\n<p>The Azul Rooftop serves up Cuban-inspired drinks and cantina vibes &mdash; along with a stunning view of Lower Manhattan. This rooftop destination has a lounge atmosphere, so it\'s a perfect spot to take a first date or have a relaxing cocktail with your closest friends.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.elsewherebrooklyn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elsewhere</a></h3>\r\n<p>This spacious Bushwick dance floor has been converted into a beautiful rooftop location, so if you live in the area there\'s no need to trek to Manhattan to enjoy a cocktail and some views. They\'re only open Thursday through Sunday, so this might just be the spot to unwind after a long week of WFH.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'kelly-sikkema-AgJdd_HgFPw-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2020-08-27 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

So grab your mask and go explore all that the city has to offer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thehighline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1. Stroll down the High Line at sunset</a></h3>\r\n<p>We\'ve missed the quintessential New York stroll down the High Line these past few months, but thankfully the beautiful elevated walkway has reopened and is allowing visitors with their free timed-entry reservation system. The High Line offers a unique view of the city&nbsp;from the skyscrapers along the Hudson River and cuts through neighborhoods like the Meatpacking District and Hudson Yards. With flowering gardens, art installations and views down bustling Manhattan boulevards, this converted freight rail is a must-see for any New Yorker. The walkway is only open from 12 p.m to 8 p.m, so we recommend reserving in advance and grabbing dinner nearby once the park has closed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.nybg.org/nybg-reopens/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=reopening&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw4rf6BRAvEiwAn2Q76tlk76zYV8869OnnEfaKR49E3lGn2ilFyyd97WOZfWn5OUGhXZElVBoCLQAQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2. Explore the acres at New York Botanical Garden</a></h3>\r\n<p>The sprawling 250 acres botanical garden in the Bronx is a perfect destination for those in search of a lush green getaway. From a natural waterfall at the Bronx River to sprawling meadows, the Botanical Gardens are a much-needed escape from the concrete jungle. The gardens are also using a timed-entry ticket system to keep track of visitor numbers &mdash; we recommend buying tickets online to ensure entry!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">3. Check out the Museum of Modern Art</a></h3>\r\n<p>Through September 27 you can score free tickets to the MoMA in Manhattan, which usually costs between $14 and $25 each. Each week of timed tickets opens on Friday at 10:00 a.m and are sold out quickly, so set an alarm and get ready to reserve your spot before they\'re gone! Artists like Judd, Felix Feneon and Dorothea Lange are spotlighted in this&nbsp;iconic New York City art museum &mdash; there\'s something for everyone at the MoMA. We recommend reserving a brunch spot nearby afterward so you can sip a latte while contemplating your favorite collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>4. Take a trip to the thrift shops in Brooklyn</h3>\r\n<p>If you want to score some signature clothing without emptying your wallet, Brooklyn is rife with thrift stores and vintage spots that make a perfect day trip. Start off at Urban Jungle on Knickerbocker Ave before browsing Le Point Value Thrift, which is conveniently located just around the corner. You can head to Beacon\'s Closet two blocks away for&nbsp;a more curated clothing store experience &mdash; or stop at Dobbin Street Vintage Outpost for some&nbsp;funky furniture finds. Don\'t forget to sanitize your hands before and after entering the stores and wear your mask at all times while indoors!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>5. Sip on a rooftop cocktail&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>There\'s nothing quite as luxurious as sipping on your favorite cocktail on a New York rooftop. Check out our recommendations here (link to last article), with everything from converted Bushwick dance floors to elegant 360-degree views from Manhattan. Grab your closest friends, some mouthwatering appetizers and enjoy a refreshing drink outdoors while the weather is still nice!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@simon_bak?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Simon Bak</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/high-line?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>', 'simon-bak-Tr05QjOiVVw-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2020-09-01 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

You can find hidden gems on your street that will make anywhere feel like home. Here\'s how to get settled in and make the most of your corner of the Big Apple.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Midnight bites</h4>\r\n<p>If you\'re hankering for a pint of ice cream, a deli sandwich, or some falafel over rice, locating the nearest 24/7 one-stop-shop for all your snacking needs is essential. We recommend comparing prices at your three nearest shops to find the cheapest (and closest) eats because none of us are immune to the allure of a midnight snack.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Go-to cocktail&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>Whenever you\'re in need of a nightcap or glass of wine after a long day at work, your local bar is the best spot to get the job done. Check out happy hour deals and use it as an excuse to meet people from around your neighborhood or invite a friend to see your side of the city.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Green spaces</h4>\r\n<p>Though New York might be known as the concrete jungle, most neighborhoods have parks within walking distance so you can take some much-needed time out in nature. This is a great way to get a read on your neighborhood &mdash; we recommend heading over around sunset with a bottle of wine and a good book. Whether it\'s Central Park or Herbert Von King, having a quiet respite from the hustle of the city is a great way to unwind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Scope the subway</h4>\r\n<p>Admittedly some neighborhoods in New York are more convenient to commute from than others, but the best way to get around efficiently is by becoming a master of public transportation. Find your two nearest stations and compare wait times, subway lines and distance from home.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>One stop coffee shop</h4>\r\n<p>Whether you prefer a fancy and frothed latte or just need a piping hot cup of coffee to go, finding a cafe on your block will come in handy. Most neighborhoods have at least a few in a two block radius, so we recommend scoping out the nearest spots to find your favorite brew. Next time you\'re late for work or in dire need of a pick-me-up you won\'t need to bumble around before finding the best spot for a warm drink.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@thoutbox?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Yonghyun Lee</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/brooklyn?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'yonghyun-lee-du8ofFw7U9E-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2020-09-21 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

For the foodies&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>There\'s no better way to celebrate a day at home than ordering a three-course meal with a friend, roommate or partner. If you\'re feeling especially fancy you can set up your own at-home restaurant, complete with a bottle of wine and some candles.

Get your tickets online, bundle up and grab your mask before making your way to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the MoMa, American Museum of Natural History, the Whitney, Brooklyn Museum or Guggenheim.

Get creative with unique recipes and decorative flourishes before finishing off with scorecards to determine who is a barista-to-be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>4. For adventurers</h3>\r\n<p>The city\'s parks are especially beautiful when covered in fresh snow, so there\'s no better time to explore than after a winter storm. You\'ll want to bundle up in your warmest gear before trekking through deep snowbanks, making snowpeople or finding the best hill to sled down.

We could all use a little extra loving this year, whether you\'re spending the holiday with a partner or a few friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Staycation</h3>\r\n<p>Get out and plan a staycation in the city, complete with a night at one of New York\'s hotels. There\'s plenty of options, from a wallet-friendly stay at <a href=\"https://www.arlohotels.com/arlo-nomad/rooms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Arlo Nomad</a> to a more luxurious trip to <a href=\"https://www.thebeekman.com/?utm_source=local-listings&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=local-listings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Beekman</a> hotel.

Their coffee is hands-down the best brew I\'ve had in New York City, and the eclectic, brick-laden walls make for the perfect spot to read a book or catch up with a friend. I recommend either Rocket Fuel (cold brew, chicory, Vermont maple syrup) for a serious caffeine boost or the Voodoo Child (Vietnamese cold brew with sweet cream) if you\'re feeling sweet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Picnic at McCarren Park</h3>\r\n<p>On any given day, you\'ll find McCarren Park bustling with activity&mdash;whether it\'s baseball games, outdoor comedy shows or family barbeques there\'s never a shortage of top-notch people-watching. Bring a blanket, some pastries and have your own picnic spread at this lovely Brooklynite hotspot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Grab a signature Polish snack</h3>\r\n<p>While you\'re in Greenpoint, it\'s a mere obligation to grab some classic Polish food. The neighborhood is home to a large Polish-American community, so you can find an authentic pierogi just around the corner. We recommend Polka Dot, Pyza, or Krolewskie Jadlo.</p>\r\n<h3>Shop through the streets</h3>\r\n<p>From unique <a href=\"https://fengsway.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">home goods stores</a> stocked up with disco balls and vintage furniture to curated thrift shops like <a href=\"https://www.awokevintage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Awoke Vintage</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://beaconscloset.com/pages/greenpoint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beacon\'s Closet</a>, there\'s plenty of eclectic boutiques for you to meander through in Greenpoint. Unlike other shopping destinations like SoHo or Williamsburg, Greenpoint is fairly calm, so you won\'t need to elbow through hordes of people to snag a blouse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Eat a delicious dinner</h3>\r\n<p>There\'s no better way to end the day than with some bites at a local Greenpoint eatery. Whether you\'re craving Thai, Polish, Vietnamese or a vegan meal, you can find the dish of your dreams in this neighborhood. We highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.diandi.nyc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Di and Di\'s </a>modern Vietnamese food&mdash;the outdoor seating is always packed for good reason. Their caramel braised pork belly, fried fish sausage bowl, and egg noodles are all worth writing home about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Catch the sunset at WNYC Transmitter Park&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Before the day is done, head to the small waterside WNYC Transmitter park for a glorious sunset over the Manhattan skyline. Unlike other waterfront parks, this one isn\'t jam-packed, so you\'ll be able to find a bench and enjoy the stunning view as dusk settles in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mirador9?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Bryan G.</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/greenpoint-brooklyn?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>', 'bryan-g-IuFgf-LncdI-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2021-05-27 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

The upstairs bar is great for cocktails with friends and becomes more crowded as the night goes on, while the downstairs area is usually hosted by a DJ, complete with circling disco balls overhead.

Apartment buildings here are closely packed, but the streets have a cozy vibe and are often tree-lined. It can be hard to believe you&rsquo;re so close to Manhattan, or even the East River, where you&rsquo;ll find a couple of waterfront parks and piers.</p>\r\n<p>The Greenpoint House is just a few blocks from the waterfront. Recently renovated, it has spacious living rooms, hardwood floors, large windows, and basement and backyard amenities. It&rsquo;s hard to find a spacious apartment at a reasonable price in New York City, but we&rsquo;ve found the perfect spot right here in Greenpoint.</p>\r\n<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s only a 2-minute walk to the Greenpoint Ave. subway station, where you can take the G train, transfer to the L in two stops, and be in Manhattan in just 30 minutes. There are also multiple bus lines running through the neighborhood. And when you feel you need a little open space, WNYC Transmitter Park and McCarren Park are just blocks away, as are Bushwick Inlet Park and Marsha P. Johnson State Park.</p>\r\n<div class=\"img_slider\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img title=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-1), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/greenpoint-backyard-3.1200x1200.jpg\" alt=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-1)\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img title=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-2), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/greenpoint-common-area-5.1200x1200.jpg\" alt=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-2)\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img title=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-3), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/the-greenpoint-house-kitchen-2.1200x1200.jpg\" alt=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-3)\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img title=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-4), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/the-greenpoint-house-bedroom-2_1.1200x1200.jpg\" alt=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-4)\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"img\"><img title=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-5), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/the-greenpoint-house-bedroom-1_1.1200x1200.jpg\" alt=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-5)\" /></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"Cost\" class=\"anchor_block\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Cost of Living in Greenpoint, Brooklyn</h2>\r\n<p>The cost of living overall in Brooklyn is quite high.

The restaurant&rsquo;s open layout and chic decor are inviting, as well.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Madre: 214 Franklin St.</em></strong> &ndash; This self-described contemporary restaurant focuses on providing warm service and a relaxed, casual vibe. According to the business, it sources produce, seafood, and meats from local farmers.

The area, including Williamsburg and Bushwick, was purchased by the Dutch in 1638. It was named for an abundance of trees. During the 1800s, it became a center for glass and pottery making, cast-iron manufacturing, and printing, as well as for oil refineries. It was also a shipbuilding and heavy manufacturing center.</p>\r\n<p>The Monitor, a Civil War gunship, was launched from here in 1862. But Greenpoint&rsquo;s modern history is shaped by the settling of Polish, Russian, and Italian immigrants from the 1880s on, a trend that continued following World War II. Actress Mae West was born in Greenpoint in 1893. Starting in the 1990s, the neighborhood began a transformation as young newcomers sparked a surge in apartment rentals and opening of the small restaurants that line the busy streets today.</p>\r\n<p class=\"img\"><img title=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-8), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/greenpoint-brooklyn-living-guide-2021-3.jpg\" alt=\"Greenpoint, Brooklyn Living Guide 2021 (Image-8)\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"Apply\" class=\"anchor_block\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Apply with Outpost Club Today</h2>\r\n<p><em>We offer modern coliving at affordable prices in Brooklyn and Manhattan.

For housing, Harlem has been given a housing ranking of 348.1; in fact, the median home cost is over $804,000 and the rankings for groceries, utilities, and transportation are high as well.</p>\r\n<p>According to the latest numbers (as of Q2 2021), the median asking rent for Central Harlem is $2,375, which is just a little higher than East Harlem or West Harlem, based on a study by StreetEasy. Fortunately, you can save by applying with Outpost Club and choosing one of our great options. And you can find opportunities to take in Harlem&rsquo;s live music and vibrant nightlife, not to mention cultural cuisine and so much more the area has to offer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"img\"><img title=\"Harlem, Manhattan Living Guide 2021 (Image-5), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/the-harlem-house-move-in-1.jpg\" alt=\"Harlem, Manhattan Living Guide 2021 (Image-5)\" /></p>\r\n<div id=\"Safety\" class=\"anchor_block\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Safety in Harlem</h2>\r\n<p>Despite its historical reputation for crime, Harlem is generally a very safe place to live. There has been lots of residential development in recent years. Its brownstone-lined blocks are often quaint and just fine for a daily stroll. In fact, Harlem is a great neighborhood to live in and explore. You might even encounter some intriguing street art or a delicious restaurant or pizzeria!</p>\r\n<p class=\"img\"><img title=\"Harlem, Manhattan Living Guide 2021 (Image-6), outpost-club.com\" src=\"../files/uploads/blog/the-harlem-house-move-in-2.jpg\" alt=\"Harlem, Manhattan Living Guide 2021 (Image-6)\" /></p>\r\n<div id=\"Restaurants\" class=\"anchor_block\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h2>Restaurants in Harlem</h2>\r\n<p><strong>There are many different restaurants to choose from along Harlem&rsquo;s busy thoroughfares. You can frequent a favorite spot or always have something new to try. Some of Harlem&rsquo;s best-kept dining secrets include:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>The Edge Harlem: 101 Edgecombe Avenue</em></strong> &ndash; If you like jerk chicken or jerk seafood dishes, expect to spend around $15 to $20. But if you&rsquo;re on a tighter budget, there are plenty of choices on the brunch menu and dinner menu reflecting a touch of British and Jamaican heritage. The Edge Harlem was established in 2014 to pay tribute to the spirit of Harlem; known for its cozy rustic d&eacute;cor, it is situated in a building where Langston Hughes and other key Harlem Renaissance figures met.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>The Noodle: 370 Malcom X Boulevard</em></strong> &ndash; The menu is a plethora of spicy cumin and curry dishes, soup noodle dishes, vegetarian/vegan options, dumplings, wontons, and &ldquo;Street Eats&rdquo; like a Scallion Pancake, Bao Slider, and Veggie Spring Roll. Most main dishes are in the $14 to $16 range. And this is just its opening menu; on the restaurant&rsquo;s website, the owners promise new additions to come.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Clay: 553 Manhattan Ave.</em></strong> &ndash; The decor is rustic and there are plentiful food options on the menu. For brunch, you can get avocado toast, pancakes, sandwiches, oysters, and other choices at Brooklyn prices. The \"Sundowner\" menu consists of baked in-house goodies, burgers, appetizers, salads, and desserts while the dinner menu offers a choice of fish, chicken, pasta, and steak.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Clove Indian Restaurant &amp; Bar: 1592 Amsterdam Ave.</em></strong>&ndash; The menu consists of appetizers, soups, salads, curries, kurma, biriyani, malai, and other Indian delicacies. There&rsquo;s also a vegetarian menu, or you can select from a range of sizzling tandoori dishes and chef specialties. There&rsquo;s a lot to pick from but the prices are fairly standard for New York Indian food. And with a beer and alcohol menu, you can stay for the nightlife too.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Belle Harlem: 2363 Adam Clayton Powell Blvd</em></strong> &ndash; Originally opening as a chef&rsquo;s table concept, Belle modified this format with more distanced tables and a covered patio. The menu consists of fresh bagels and pastries and a compact selection of breakfast and lunch items, including an omelet, oatmeal, quiche, or elbow pasta with sausage and broccolini in an herbed garlic cream sauce. And, you can grab yourself a cup of hot chocolate while you&rsquo;re at it!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Sign Up with Outpost Club Today</h2>\r\n<p><em>Outpost Club offers affordable living options in urban areas where rental prices are high.

And while that might deter some eager wanderers from making the Big Apple home, there are plenty of ways you can save money and still experience all New York has to offer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Transportation</h3>\r\n<p>We\'re not above a super-late night Uber ride, but let\'s be real, taxis and shared ride services add up&mdash;and quick. Getting aquainted with the MTA systems is one of the best ways you can save your hard-earned money in the city, as you can get virtually anywhere for the cost of 2.75. We recommend tallying up your monthly MTA charges before deciding if the month pass is worth the cost&mdash;it\'ll be $127 for a month of unlimited swipes or $33 for a week. If you\'re working from home or only taking the train on the weekends you can probably save your coins and purchase individual tickets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And in warmer months, biking is another affordable alternative so you can skip the wait times or crowded L train. Buying a bike of your own will be more of a long-term investment, or you can opt for a membership with <a href=\"https://citibikenyc.com/pricing/annual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Citi Bike</a>, which are stationed all over the five boroughs. A one-month membership is $15, or you can get set-up for a full year for just $179.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Housing</h3>\r\n<p>You\'ll likely end up spending the largest amount on money on housing, as New York is also designated as the <a href=\"https://www.fortunebuilders.com/top-10-u-s-cities-with-the-highest-rents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">most expensive place to rent</a> in the U.S. Don\'t let that discourage you&mdash;because there are more affordable options out there. The most essential tip is to plan on having roommates, as you\'ll split the apartment cost into a fraction of its original price. We also recommend looking outside of Manhattan for your next home, as it is the most expensive borough for both renting and day-to-day costs. And if you want to save money without skipping out on amenities like furnished apartments, laundry or even in-building fitness studios, co-living spaces are a no-stress way to get settled in the city on a budget.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Food&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>You won\'t want to miss out on the global cuisine NYC has to offer, with everything from vegan Ethiopian eats to flavorful hot pot to try. For meals out on a budget, scour your local listings for happy hours, bottomless brunch or other deals so you can save while still enjoying the city\'s foodie scene. We also recommend straying from the crowds and Insta-famous restaurants if you\'re serious about saving money&mdash;there are plenty of authentic restaurants that won\'t cost an arm and a leg for an appetizer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And when it comes time to grocery shop, compare prices from your nearest stores to find the cheapest option. If the nearest stores are all priced at a similar level (and a bit out-of-budget), you may want to trek to the nearest Trader Joe\'s. While not as convenient as walking down the block, you can usually save a significant amount of money on your weekly haul. For produce, always consult your local bodega to get unreal deals on fruits and vegetables. A grocery store might charge you as much as $5 for a container of blackberries, which you can get for around $1 at your nearest market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Entertainment&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>One of the greatest parts of NYC is the never-ending myriad of places to see&mdash;from namesake museums to the next show on Broadway. You can still experience all the city has to offer without disrupting your budget with a bit of prior planning. Almost every museum in the city <a href=\"https://www.thefearlessforeigner.com/destinations/north-america/united-states/new-york/how-to-save-money-living-in-nyc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">offers a free or pay-what-you-can day</a>, so you can get access to places like the MoMa or Guggenheim Museum without dropping a dime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can also get your very own <a href=\"https://a069-idnyconlineportal.nyc.gov/IOPWeb/#/EN/NewApplication\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NYC ID</a>, which unlocks deals, discounts and free tickets to a plethora of events, shows and entertainment throughout the city.

Before you consult your food delivery apps again, let\'s run through easy ways you can cook from home with only the help of a microwave. This standard, compact and cost-effective appliance can create surprisingly nutritious and satiating meals with the press of a button.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Cook evenly</h3>\r\n<p>It\'s no secret that the dishes you put in the microwave will determine how much time they need to be nuked for. Generally, large, dense or thick ingredients will need more time to heat thoroughly. To prevent food from cooking unevenly, separate large ingredients from the smaller ingredients so you don\'t end up with raw food or unsavory overcooked bits. Another way to hack through this problem is to slice the larger ingredients into smaller pieces&mdash;think large vegetables, meat, and potatoes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another key way to ensure your dish cooks thoroughly is to arrange the food in a single layer on a microwave-safe dish, with the thicker or larger pieces away from the center of the dish. When using a microwave, the food at the outskirts of your plate will cook more quickly, so arranging your ingredients intentionally can help you achieve an even cook.</p>\r\n<p>We also recommend cooking in intervals and stirring or mixing to distribute the heat. For small items you can cook at one-minute intervals, while larger ingredients like meat can cook for longer periods like three minute intervals. While this takes a bit more patience then simply nuking your meal for seven minutes flat, it will ensure you don\'t have any frozen or cold portions in the center with steaming hot outskirts of your dish.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Avoid the mess</h3>\r\n<p>Cooking on the stovetop will generally mean a pile of dirty dishes to clean, which is yet another benefit of using a microwave to whip up your next meal. To avoid the dreaded microwave splatter, be sure to puncture foods with a skin like sausages and potatoes&mdash;otherwise they might burst and create a mess. We also recommend covering your dishes with a microwave-safe lid, while leaving a small gap for steam to escape. In addition to preventing splatter, a lid will also ensure even cooking and keep mositure locked in so you don\'t have any dry bites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Play with the microwave\'s power</h3>\r\n<p>Many of us default to using the factory settings on our microwave while cooking, which leaves out an array of temperature adjustments that can help us cook more precisely using this appliance. We don\'t cook two dishes the exact same way on the stovetop, so why would we in the microwave? Most microwaves wattage can be adjusted using the set power button, so you can tailor your cooking experience to the meal at hand. Nuking with less power is one way to slow down the process, which can actually help you avoid overcooking certain portions of your meal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Get it delivered</h3>\r\n<p>Feel like no amount of convenience beats opening Seamless? Meal delivery services like <a href=\"https://www.freshly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freshly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cookunity.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">CookUnity</a> will deliver fresh, prepared meals straight to your door, so you can just pop one in the microwave and feel confident you\'re getting the nutrients you need without a bunch of added sugar and over-processing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Meals to try</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/microwave-kale-chilli-eggs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kale and chilli eggs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/microwave-mac-n-cheese\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mac n\' cheese</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/microwave-peanut-butter-and-jam-brownies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peanut butter and jam cookies</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/use-a-bowl-to-cook-crispy-bacon-in-the-microwave-5990895\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crispy bacon</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://savorysweetlife.com/how-to-microwave-salmon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flaky salmon</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://greatist.com/health/surprising-healthy-microwave-recipes#lunch-and-dinner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mushroom risotto</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cooksmarts.com/articles/microwaved-broccoli-with-lemon-and-garlic-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steamed broccoli</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@andreaedavis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andrea Davis</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unsplash</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'microwave-cooking.jpeg', 1, '2021-10-06 05:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

These resolutions aren\'t subjective, so they\'re easier to quantify, track and monitor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Hold yourself accountable</h3>\r\n<p>If you\'re the only person who knows about your New Year\'s resolution you\'re less likely to see it come to fruition.&nbsp;Make a promise to your friends, family, or even social media followers who will keep you accountable throughout the year, and even offer positive reinforcement when you give updates on your success. While avoiding the embarassment of failure might not be the most noble of motivations, it can certainly keep you from sliding into too great of a slump that you forgo your resolutions completely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Create a plan</h3>\r\n<p>A concrete goal is a great place to start, but can also feel daunting if it\'s an entirely new habit or skill you\'re trying to pick up. This is where prior planning comes in hand&mdash;so you can design a toolbox that can get you from point A to point B with as little distractions as possible. For example, if your goal is to read one book per month, you could plan by picking your first four books and designating a certain time per day for reading (whether it be 15 minutes while you drink coffee in the morning or reading 20 pages per day before bed). Creating incremental changes will help you create long-term habits and patterns as they become established within your routine. Plus, planning out&nbsp;<em>how&nbsp;</em>you\'ll achieve this goal will save you from the stress of realizing you\'re 12 pages in to a new novel on the last day of the month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Find inspiration that will last</h3>\r\n<p>This can look different depending on your goals&mdash;but when January is over and your new year rigor is fading, refer to external inspiration to keep motivated. If you have a friend who has a similar goal (re: does&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>need to be exactly the same), you can designate an accountability buddy that checks in with each other\'s progress and performance on a regular basis. It will help you both stay honest with how you\'re doing, plus can be a fun way to connect with someone who has shared interests.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you don\'t like the idea of relying on an accountability buddy, there are plenty of other ways to cultivate inspiration. You can create vision boards that incorporate your goals and place it in an easy-to-see location, print mantras or reminders to hang in your home or follow influencers or leaders who share insight and tips.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Reward yourself for success</h3>\r\n<p>Admittedly some New Year\'s resolutions can feel like a chore&mdash;whether it\'s improving your studying skills or starting a new fitness regimen, it\'s not always easy or fun to begin. If you find yourself struggling to self-motivate, instill a reward for following through with your goals. For example, if you want to walk for forty minutes every day, you can incentivize this new habit by adding a small reward to the task, like a latte at your favorite coffee shop to sip on while you stroll. Keep in mind that the reward should not counteract your goal&mdash;so if you\'re trying to dial down on screen time and read more, the treat for reading a chapter should not be an hour of Netflix binging.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rovenimages_com?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Roven Images</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/new-years?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>', 'roven-images-HxeBUWUiA1A-unsplash.jpg', 1, '2022-01-04 06:00:00', NULL, NULL, 0, 0),

It\'s no surpise that the restaurant has multiple locations across the city, as their decadent broth, range of customizable toppings and traditional appetizers make them an ideal spot for anyone hankering for noodles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://kochinyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kochi</a></h3>\r\n<p>Head to Kochi for Korean fare that is Michelin star approved. You can opt for the tasting menu to savor a wide variety of flavors, from seared scallops with tiger\'s milk to slow cooked pork tenderloin with kimchi. Certainly a pricer meal than some of our other contendors, but the flavors will be hard to find anywhere else.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.empmamanyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Empanada Mama</a></h3>\r\n<p>For those who want an affordable meal that won\'t sacrifice any flavor or satiety, check out Empanada Mama and pick up a few savory stuffed pastries for just $3.99 each.

We recommend the root vegetable puffs, wok ginger curry with calamari or nakorn-patom duck noodle soup.</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://torishinny.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tori Shin</a></h3>\r\n<p>Hell\'s Kitchen is home to one of New York City\'s best yakitori spots, boasting a robust menu of Waygu, Iberico pork, tenderloin, mentai chazuke and rice dishes. While the prices and selection vary greatly, this is an ideal spot for a celebration, birthday or somewhat swanky date night. We recommend reserving in advance, as tables are in high demand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://nizzanyc.com/menu/-dinner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nizza</a></h3>\r\n<p>No New York restaurant round-up can be completed without an Italian pick&mdash;and Nizza proudly takes the spotlight among the eateries in Hell\'s Kitchen. This spot serves up the area\'s best pizza and pasta, not to mention the entirely gluten-free menu they have on standby.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.donburiyany.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Donburiya</a></h3>\r\n<p>With an expansive menu offering everything from noodles and rice to ishiyaki and donburi, this is the place to be in Hell\'s Kitchen if you need a Japanese food fix.

This is a guide to make your move in successful. We&rsquo;ve done this many times before so we know the drill! To start, here is your address: 780 Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 11221</strong></em></h2>\r\n<hr class=\"hr\" />\r\n<h3>House Leader</h3>\r\n<p>First, get to know your house leader. They will be your point of contact for questions and concerns.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"fx w vc ch2\">\r\n<div><img id=\"cldfkgliklaggnopdgnepabenoiiopbi\" style=\"display: block; top: 787px; left: 1089px; z-index: 1999; position: absolute; cursor: pointer; background-color: transparent; background-image: none; border: none; opacity: 1; max-width: 24px; max-height: 24px; transition: all 50ms ease 0s;\" src=\"chrome-extension://cldfkgliklaggnopdgnepabenoiiopbi/ptlite-icon_32.png\" alt=\"\" /><img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"../files/uploads/august_lock.gif\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>How to use an August Lock</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>Getting in the building</h3>\r\n<p>All interior doors are locked with an August Lock. An August Lock is an electronic lock that uses an application called <strong><a class=\"green\" href=\"http://august.com/\" target=\"_blank\">August</a></strong>&nbsp;that you can use to unlock it. Find it in the app store, create an account, and ask your house leader to give you access.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Wifi</h3>\r\n<p>As always, you need wifi. The wifi name is Outpost (or some variation of that) and the password is befreenyc (all lower case).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>ID</h3>\r\n<p>For our records, we need a picture of your Photo ID. The house leader will take a picture of it</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Communication with Other Residents</h3>\r\n<p>We use facebook messenger to communicate, so the house leader will need to add you to the group. If you don&rsquo;t have a facebook, please continually check in with the house leader to see if there is important house news you need to know.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>See the House</h3>\r\n<p>The house leader will show you your room (if they haven&rsquo;t already). Note your bed number, which can be found on your bed frame. Take a look at the house with the house leader. If you would like to lock away your valuables, use the lockers in the basement. Outpost Club is not responsible for the safety of your valuables and we do not provide locks, just lockers.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Kitchen</h3>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need a section of the fridge, which is partition by area so that everyone has equal access. If you open the fridge, you&rsquo;ll see each section has a letter and a number corresponding with your bed. Use this area of the fridge for your items, and talk to others in the house if you need more space. This goes for the cabinets as well: find your section, which will be labeled by your bed number.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Events</h3>\r\n<p>The Outpost Club will also be holding events at your place and at all the Outpost Club locations, so make sure to ask the house leader about any upcoming events. Additionally we have a facebook group for all Outpost Club members in New York. This group has announcement about events, opportunities in New York, general announcements, and more good stuff.&nbsp;<strong><a class=\"green\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/outpostclub/\" target=\"_blank\">You can request to join that group here</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Cleanliness</h3>\r\n<p>The common spaces of the house are used by a lot of people so please keep them clean! There are some easy ways to think about cleanliness at Outpost Club:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Leave rooms in the condition that you found them&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Clean up after yourself</li>\r\n<li>Do not leave your personal stuff out in common areas if you are not going to return immediately</li>\r\n<li>When it\'s your turn to contribute, contribute! Check the cleaning boards for your day of resposibilities, and if your name is not there&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, the notes around the house are there to reduce confusion and make the community run smoothly, so follow the notes!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Extensions</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, we happy to have our members stay longer, however we can\'t extend you stay if we don\'t know about your extension! As soon as you are aware of the need to extend your stay, let us know by emailing bookings@outpost-club.com.&nbsp;<strong>If you have not committed to an extension, your bed can be reserved by anyone admitted to Outpost Club.</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"center\"><a class=\"button2\" href=\"current-members\">Return to Current Members Page</a></div>\r\n<hr class=\"hr\" />', 2, '40.69082275', '-73.94161214', 498, '', '2022-08-22 15:07:30'),

You may find your package left inside the main door, concealed outside, with a roommate who picked it up for you or returned to a distribution center for a later delivery. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to track your packages and make sure you&rsquo;re home to receive them when necessary.</p>\r\n</div>', 2, '40.69126000', '-73.90590000', 0, '', NULL),

This is a guide to make your move in successful. We&rsquo;ve done this many times before so we know the drill! To start, here is your address: 118 Kingsland ave, Brooklyn, NY, 11222</em></strong></h2>\r\n<hr class=\"hr\" />\r\n<h3>House Leader</h3>\r\n<p>First, get to know your house leader. They will be your point of contact for questions and concerns.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"fx w vc ch2\">\r\n<div><img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"../files/uploads/august_lock.gif\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>How to use the August lock</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>Getting in the Building</h3>\r\n<p>All exterior and interior doors are locked with an August Lock. An August Lock is an electronic lock that uses an application called <a class=\"green\" href=\"http://august.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>August</strong></a>&nbsp;that you can use to unlock it. Find it in the app store, create an account, and ask your house leader to give you access.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Wifi</h3>\r\n<p>As always, you need wifi. The wifi name is Outpost (or some variation of that) and the password is befreenyc (all lower case).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>ID</h3>\r\n<p>For our records and according to state law, we&rsquo;ll need a picture of your photo ID. Either a national ID or a passport will work. The house leader will take a picture of it when you move in.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Communication With Other Residents</h3>\r\n<p>We use facebook messenger to communicate, so the house leader will need to add you to the group. If you don&rsquo;t have a facebook, please continually check in with the house leader to see if there is important house news you need to know.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>See The House</h3>\r\n<p>The house leader will show you your room (if they haven&rsquo;t already). Note your bed number, which can be found on your bed frame. Take a look at the house with the house leader. If you would like to lock away your valuables, use the lockers in the basement. Outpost Club is not responsible for the safety of your valuables and we do not provide locks, just lockers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Kitchen</h3>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need a section of the fridge, which is partition by area so that everyone has equal access.&nbsp;If you open the fridge, you&rsquo;ll see each section has a letter and a number corresponding with your bed. Use this area of the fridge for your items, and talk to others in the house if you need more space. This goes for the cabinets as well: find your section, which will be labeled by your bed number.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Events</h3>\r\n<p>The Outpost Club will also be holding events at your place and at all the Outpost Club locations, so make sure to ask the house leader about any upcoming events. Additionally we have a facebook group for all Outpost Club members in New York. This group has announcement about events, opportunities in New York, general announcements, and more good stuff.&nbsp;<a class=\"green\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/outpostclub/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>You can request to join that group here</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Cleanliness</h3>\r\n<p>The common spaces of the house are used by a lot of people so please keep them clean!

This is a guide to make your move in successful. We&rsquo;ve done this many times before so we know the drill! To start, here is your address: 719 Seneca Ave, Flushing, NY, 11385</strong></em></h2>\r\n<h3><strong>House Leader</strong></h3>\r\n<p>First, get to know your house leader. They will be your point of contact for questions and concerns.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"fx w vc ch2\">\r\n<div><img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"../files/uploads/august_lock.gif\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>How to use the August Lock</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>Getting In The Building</h3>\r\n<p>The code to the outside door is 1212. All interior doors are locked with an August Lock. An August Lock is an electronic lock that uses an application called <strong><a class=\"green\" href=\"http://august.com/\" target=\"_blank\">August</a></strong>&nbsp;that you can use to unlock it. Find it in the app store, create an account, and ask your house leader to give you access.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Wifi</strong></h3>\r\n<p>As always, you need wifi. The wifi name is Outpost (or some variation of that) and the password is befreenyc (all lower case).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>ID</strong></h3>\r\n<p>For our records and according to state law, we&rsquo;ll need a picture of your photo ID. Either a national ID or a passport will work. The house leader will take a picture of it when you move in.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Communication with Other Residents</h3>\r\n<p>We use facebook messenger to communicate, so the house leader will need to add you to the group.

Note your bed number, which can be found on your bed frame. Take a look at the house with the house leader. If you would like to lock away your valuables, use the lockers in the basement. Outpost Club is not responsible for the safety of your valuables and we do not provide locks, just lockers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Kitchen</h3>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need a section of the fridge, which is partition by area so that everyone has equal access.&nbsp;If you open the fridge, you&rsquo;ll see each section has a letter and a number corresponding with your bed. Use this area of the fridge for your items, and talk to others in the house if you need more space. This goes for the cabinets as well: find your section, which will be labeled by your bed number.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Events</h3>\r\n<p>The Outpost Club will also be holding events at your place and at all the Outpost Club locations, so make sure to ask the house leader about any upcoming events.

This is a guide to make your move-in successful. We&rsquo;ve done this many times before so we know the drill! To start, here is your address: <a class=\"green\" href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/126+Douglass+St,+Brooklyn,+NY+11217/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c25a5149796edd:0x96878e836ad44f9f?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE686AyczbAhWJpFkKHTg1BoIQ8gEIJjAA\" target=\"_blank\">126 Douglass Street, Brooklyn, NY, 11217</a></strong></em></h2>\r\n<hr class=\"hr\" />\r\n<div class=\"fx w vc ch2\">\r\n<div><img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"../files/uploads/august_lock.gif\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>How to use an August Lock</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3>Getting In The Building</h3>\r\n<p>All exterior and interior doors are locked with an August Lock. An August Lock is an electronic lock that uses an application called <strong><a class=\"green\" href=\"http://august.com/\" target=\"_blank\">August</a></strong>&nbsp;that you can use to unlock it. Find it in the app store, create an account, and ask your house manager to give you access. If your phone is dead or August will not work with your phone, the outdoor code to the first floor is <strong>#</strong><strong>0126</strong>. For the ground floor entrance, you will be given the front door code via email.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Wifi</h3>\r\n<p>As always, you need wifi. The wifi name is <strong>Outpost Club</strong>&nbsp;and the password is <strong>befreenyc</strong> (all lower case).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>ID</h3>\r\n<p>For our records and according to state law, we&rsquo;ll need a picture of your photo ID. Either a national ID or a passport will work. The house leader will take a picture of it when you move in.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Communication With Other Residents</h3>\r\n<p>We use facebook messenger to communicate, so the house leader will need to add you to the group. If you don&rsquo;t have a facebook, please continually check in with the house leader to see if there is important house news you need to know.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>See the House</h3>\r\n<p>The house leader will show you your room (if they haven&rsquo;t already). Note your room-letter, which can be found on your bedroom door frame. Take a look at the house with the house leader. If you would like to lock away your valuables, use the lockers located in the basement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Kitchen</h3>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need a section of the fridge, which is partition by area so that everyone has equal access.&nbsp;If you open the fridge, you&rsquo;ll see each section has a letter and a number corresponding with your bed. Use this area of the fridge for your items, and talk to others in the house if you need more space. This goes for the cabinets as well: find your section, which will be labeled by your bed number.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Events</h3>\r\n<p>The Outpost Club will also be holding events at your place and at all the Outpost Club locations, so make sure to ask the house leader about any upcoming events. Additionally we have a facebook group for all Outpost Club members in New York. This group has announcement about events, opportunities in New York, general announcements, and more good stuff.&nbsp;<strong><a class=\"green\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/outpostclub/\" target=\"_blank\">You can request to join that group here</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Cleanliness</h3>\r\n<p>The common spaces of the house are used by a lot of people so please keep them clean!

Outpost Club&rsquo;s goal is to make Members feel at home from the moment arrive to the moment they leave. In order to preserve this feeling of home, Outpost Club has the rules outlined in this Membership agreement to communicate our vision of what home should be: respectful, clean, comfortable space to connect with others.</p>\r\n<p>In order to achieve this Members must not only follow the rules, but report to Outpost Club management when and if rules are being broken. Outpost Club can not enforce violations of rules by its Members that it is not aware of, therefore it is your responsibility as a Member to notify us when something is bothering you.</p>\r\n<p>Please report all violations of the rules to customer.service@outpost-club.com, or contact your House Leader or Community Manager directly. When reporting please include the time, place, and description of the violation. If the person reporting knows who is involved, we&rsquo;d appreciate if the person reporting provides that information as well but understand if they do not want to. Please understand that we made not be able to resolve the issue if we do not know who commits the violation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If Outpost Club has reason to believe that a Member has broken the rules, Outpost Club reserves the right to issue warnings, and in circumstances where the violation is heinous and/or is a threat to the community, Outpost Club reserves the right to discontinue Membership after warnings or immediately.</p>\r\n<p>If the Member has this agreement up as a couple, the Member signing this agreement is responsible for the actions of the other Member in the couple&rsquo;s relationship. All violations of this agreement by either Member of the couple are violations by the entire couple.</p>\r\n<h1 class=\"center\"><br /><br /><br /></h1>\r\n</div>', 7, '', '', '', '', 160, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'House Rules', 0, 0, 'a:0:{}', '', '', '', '', 0, '0.00000000', '0.00000000', 0, '', NULL),

Room cleanliness must be to the standard of the roommate with the highest standard of cleanliness. Everyone in the room should be comfortable bringing up the messes of others in the room as the space is shared by everyone.</p>\r\n<p>Everyone should also have equal access to the organizational tools of the room. There is ample space for everyone\'s personal items in every room, therefore if you feel you do not have equal access, feel free to bring it up with roommates and if needed, the house leader.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, use only your bed, and not other beds in the room. When new members move in to your, their bed (and the rest of the room) must be ready to accept them. Never use another bed than your own in your room, even if no one is currently renting the other bed(s). It must be prepared if/when someone else arrives!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>All Rooms</h2>\r\n<p>The cleanliness of your room is up to you: Outpost Club will not make you clean your room as that is not our place. However, there are&nbsp;their is only one&nbsp;instance in which we will need to inform you to improve the cleanliness of your room: if you are eating/leaving food in your room. This may cause mice, rats, and cockroaches to enter our houses.</p>\r\n<p>Basically, if your actions impede the operations of Outpost Club or affect the experience of our other members, we reserve the right to first ask, then warn you about the cleanliness of your room.</p>\r\n<p>If you promise to follow these policies, we can easily promise everyone a clean and prepared room/bed upon arrival, and for the duration of everyone&rsquo;s stay!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Guest policy</h2>\r\n<p>Tenancy&nbsp;is only for you &ndash; overnight stay is for you only. If you would like to have an overnight guest, you must:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Tell your house leader at least one week in advance</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Tell our customer service department via email at <a href=\"mailto:customer.service@outpost-club.com\">customer.service@outpost-club.com</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>If you are an airbnb client, Outpost Club does not allow for overnight guests. If you are staying with us directly and have a lease, you\'ll find in the lease that you are allowed to have overnight guests 2 nights per week without charge. If you would like to have an overnight guest for longer in a separate room, please&nbsp;email&nbsp;the customer service team and&nbsp;they can provide you with availibilty and pricing. If you are looking to have someone stay in your own room for an extended period of time, they would be considered as a tenant, and would need to be added to the lease. This would come with additional payment as well, depending on the length of stay, room type, etc.</p>\r\n<p>If you are found having guest over without permission, we will assess a fine, in addition to assessing a per-night overnight guest fee. The fine is assess for having broken our rules, compromised security of the house, and violated the mutual agreement made by all members of our community.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to this, No guests after quiet hours, unless they are an approved overnight guest.

The Program Rules are in addition to any agreements between you and Outpost Club. The Outpost Club Terms are incorporated by reference and shall apply to your participation in the Outpost Club Referral Program, including, if necessary, to resolve any disputes between you and Outpost Club related to or arising out of the Referral Program.</p>\r\n<p>The Outpost Club Referral Program (&ldquo;Referral Program&rdquo;) is offered by Outpost Club, Inc. and its affiliates (together referred to as &ldquo;Outpost Club&rdquo;) and provides Members who are interested in referring their family and friends (&ldquo;Referrers&rdquo;) the opportunity to refer eligible individuals to join the Outpost Club community as new Members. The Referral triggers when the Referred Member signs an agreement and pays first Invoice. These Program Rules apply to both referrers and referred Users, so please read carefully to understand your respective rights and obligations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Referrer Eligibility</h3>\r\n<p>To be eligible to participate in the Referral Program as a referrer, you must (a) be a legal resident of your country; (b) be the age of majority in your territory of residence; and (c) maintain a Outpost Club account in good standing. Referrers must be or have been an Outpost Club member (tenant) and Outpost Club can require proof of a lease or check our own systems to determine this. Referrers may be Members. A single person may use the Outpost Club Platform in several ways (for example, as a Member and Potential Member). However, if you violate the Referral Program Rules or any applicable Terms of Service, Outpost Club may suspend or terminate your ability to participate in the Referral Program under any or all of your accounts. For example, if you are a Member and you engage in prohibited referral activity under your Outpost Club account, Outpost Club may terminate your ability to participate in the Referral Program under all of your Outpost Club accounts.</p>\r\n<h3>Eligibility of the person who is referred&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>There are 2 main criteria that the person who is referred must meet in order for all benefiting parties to receive the rewards:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>The person who is referred must sign and pay for a stay at Outpost Club with a commitment that is no less than 6 months (181 days)&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n<li>The&nbsp;person who is referred must have used the referal code or name of the Referrer during the application process, to indicated - before signing - that they had been referred by the Referrer.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Outpost Club Codes</h3>\r\n<p>Under the Referral Program, Outpost Club may provide you with a unique alphanumeric code (&ldquo;Outpost Club Code&rdquo;) to distribute to eligible individuals to become new Members. Outpost Club may also provide you the ability to create additional Outpost Club Codes. Outpost Club owns all rights in and to any Outpost Club Code whether provided to you or created by you. You acknowledge and agree that: (a) Outpost Club may limit the number of Outpost Club Codes you may create or are made available to you, (b) you have no ownership rights in any form over the Outpost Club Codes, and (c) Outpost Club may reclaim, deactivate, invalidate or terminate your Outpost Club Code at any time at its discretion.</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>How to Refer New Members</h3>\r\n<h3>a. Referred MEMBERS.</h3>\r\n<p>You may refer eligible individuals to become new Members on the Outpost Club Platform. In order to be eligible for a Referral Reward (defined below) for a new Member, the person must (i) have never previously created an Outpost Club account or lived with Outpost Club; (ii) be at least the age of majority in your territory of residence, and (iii) satisfy the applicable Reward Criteria, as discussed below. If these conditions are met, the person shall be considered your &ldquo;Referred Member.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3>B. Invitations through the Outpost Club Platform.</h3>\r\n<p>You may invite your family and friends to become new Members directly through the Outpost Club Platform by entering or providing Outpost Club with your invitee&rsquo;s contact information (all information collected by Outpost Club under the Referral Program shall be governed by Outpost Club\'s Privacy Policy). Inviting an individual through the Outpost Club Platform may generate an automatic invitation text (SMS) or email (the &ldquo;Invitation&rdquo;) to the person which may be sent through your phone number or a number controlled by Outpost Club. The Invitation may contain a promotional offer of Outpost Club credit or the special offer to a new Member. You represent that you have the necessary consent from your invitee to send them the Invitation (either directly or through the Outpost Club Platform). If your invitee follows the links in your Invitation and creates a Outpost Club account using the information provided, your Outpost Club Code will be automatically applied on the new Member\'s account, as applicable.</p>\r\n<h3>C. Other Invitations.</h3>\r\n<p>You may also invite eligible individuals to become new Members by distributing your Outpost Club Code directly and instructing them to manually input your Outpost Club Code into the Outpost Club Application form.&nbsp;A Member will not be able to apply your Outpost Club Code if (i) they&rsquo;ve already applied another Member&rsquo;s Outpost Club Code or a different promotion code, (ii) they&rsquo;ve already received Outpost Club credit from Outpost Club or another source on their Member account prior to entry of your Outpost Club Code, or (iii) they already concluded an agreement with Outpost Club prior to entering your Outpost Club Code in their Account. A Member will not be able to apply your Outpost Club Code if they start their application without entering your Code. If a Member does not enter your Outpost Club Code you will not receive attribution for the referral and they will not be considered your Referred Member. Outpost Club reserves the right to supply new Members with Outpost Club credit or sign-on bonuses at its discretion.</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>Referral Rewards</h3>\r\n<h3>a. General.</h3>\r\n<p>You are eligible to earn a referral incentive (&ldquo;Referral Reward&rdquo;) for each Referred Member that you refer to the Outpost Club Platform (subject to certain maximum limits and the other terms in these Referral Program Rules). As discussed above, in order to qualify as your Referred Member, the new Member must satisfy the applicable Reward Criteria, sign the Membership Agreement and pay the first Invoice. The Reward Criteria are set by Outpost Club in its sole discretion and are subject to change at any time. Outpost Club, at its sole discretion, may make available certain promotions with different Reward Criteria or Referral Rewards to other Members or prospective Members. These promotions, unless offered to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever on your Agreement or relationship with Outpost Club.</p>\r\n<p>The Referral Rewards are triggered after a Referred Member signs an agreement and pays first Invoice.</p>\r\n<p>If the new Member that you refer satisfies the Reward Criteria, the type of Reward you are eligible to receive may depend on (i) which Outpost Club Member account you used to refer the new member, (ii) the Outpost Club region associated with your Outpost Club account, (iii) the Outpost Club region associated with the Referred Member when they apply your Outpost Club Code, or (iv) other factors as determined and communicated by Outpost Club.</p>\r\n<h3>b. Earning Rewards for Referred MEMBERS.</h3>\r\n<p>New Members you refer in some promotional cases may receive Outpost Club credit upon creating their new Outpost Club account by signing an agreement and paying the first Invoice (&ldquo;Referral Credit&rdquo;). Referral Credit is only valid for use on the Outpost Club Platform and is not transferable or redeemable for cash. Referral Credit may contain certain restrictions such as expiration dates or geographical use limitations which will be communicated to the new Member. New Members should check with their Outpost Club representative to determine whether they qualify to have Referral Credit and any restrictions on its use. In order to satisfy the Referral Criteria, the referred Member must use their first Outpost Club month credit before the Referral Credit expires, but in no event later than thirty (30) days from the creation of their Outpost Club account. All terms and conditions for the distribution and use of Referral Credit are determined by Outpost Club in its sole discretion.</p>\r\n<h3>c. Maximum Rewards for Referred MEMBERS.</h3>\r\n<p>The maximum amount of Referral Rewards that Outpost Club will pay for Referred Members is $2,000 per month (either in cash, Outpost Club credit, or a combination of the two). For example, if the Referral Reward is $250 per Referred Member and you generate 10 Referred Members in a single month, the maximum you can earn is $2,000 (in cash or Outpost Club credit) for such month.</p>\r\n<h3>D. Resolving Disputes over Referrals.</h3>\r\n<p>Only one person can earn a Referral Reward for a single Referred Member. In the event that multiple persons claim credit for a particular referral, Outpost Club has full discretion to determine which person earned such referral according to Outpost Club\'s systems.</p>\r\n<h3>E. Reservation of rights.</h3>\r\n<p>Outpost Club reserves the right to withhold or deduct Referral Rewards or Referral Credit obtained through the Referral Program in the event that Outpost Club determines or believes that the receipt of the Referral Reward or Referral Credit was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of these Referral Program Rules or any other applicable agreement between you and Outpost Club.</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>Restrictions</h3>\r\n<p>In connection with your participation in the Referral Program, you expressly agree to the restrictions listed below. When distributing, promoting or communicating your Referral Code(s) you agree that:</p>\r\n<p>If you violate any of these restrictions Outpost Club may, in its discretion, remove your eligibility to participate in the Referral Program, and/or deny you any Referral Rewards earned in violation or suspected violation of these restrictions.</p>\r\n<ol data-rte-list=\"default\">\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>No spamming.</strong> You agree that you will not &ldquo;spam&rdquo; anyone with invitations to join the Outpost Club community, and that you at all times will remain compliant with CAN-SPAM, the TCPA, and other applicable laws.

The wifi name is Outpost (or some variation of that) and the password is befreenyc (all lower case).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>ID</h3>\r\n<p>For our records and according to state law, we&rsquo;ll need a picture of your photo ID. Either a national ID or a passport will work. The house leader will take a picture of it when you move in.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Communication With Other Residents</h3>\r\n<p>We use facebook messenger to communicate, so the house leader will need to add you to the group. If you don&rsquo;t have a facebook, please continually check in with the house leader to see if there is important house news you need to know.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>See The House</h3>\r\n<p>The house leader will show you your room (if they haven&rsquo;t already). Note your bed number, which can be found on your bed frame. Take a look at the house with the house leader. If you would like to lock away your valuables, use the lockers in the basement. Outpost Club is not responsible for the safety of your valuables and we do not provide locks, just lockers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Kitchen</h3>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need a section of the fridge, which is partition by area so that everyone has equal access.&nbsp;If you open the fridge, you&rsquo;ll see each section has a letter and a number corresponding with your bed. Use this area of the fridge for your items, and talk to others in the house if you need more space. This goes for the cabinets as well: find your section, which will be labeled by your bed number.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Events</h3>\r\n<p>The Outpost Club will also be holding events at your place and at all the Outpost Club locations, so make sure to ask the house leader about any upcoming events.

Watch the video below to see what you should recycle:</p>\r\n<iframe style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/EUyVELb5PzY\" width=\"70%\" height=\"400\"></iframe><br /><br />\r\n<p><strong>Cleanliness is also required.</strong> That&rsquo;s especially true of common areas, including shared rooms. Here are some easy ways to think about cleanliness at Outpost:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Leave rooms in the condition in which you found them</li>\r\n<li>Clean up after yourself</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t leave your belongings in the common area unless you&rsquo;re returning immediately</li>\r\n<li>Pay attention to the signs around the house: They&rsquo;re there to help our community run smoothly!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Outpost is not responsible for lost or damaged mail or packages.</strong> Your House Leader will check the mail regularly. Make sure to put your full address, including your outside door code, in the delivery field when you order something. You may find your package left inside the main door, concealed outside, with a roommate who picked it up for you or returned to a distribution center for a later delivery. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to track your packages and make sure you&rsquo;re home to receive them when necessary.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, '40.80406000', '-73.95706000', 488, '', '2022-07-11 06:28:32'),

They are requested, funded, planned, and executed. Events take time, and therefore Outpost Club needs a process to hold interesting, professional, and fun events for our members. Here is how an event idea turns into reality at Outpost Club.</em></p>\r\n<h3>General Background Info</h3>\r\n<p>Events are worked into the position descriptions of many employees at Outpost Club. First is the House Leader and Outpost Club Support Team position: each house has a House Leader, and each house leader must hold two events per month. These house events can be for their house&rsquo;s member only, or they can invite people from all houses.</p>\r\n<p>The second position is the community manager: the community manager holds an additional two events per month that are company-wide events. This ideally allows each Outpost Club member to attend one event per-week. House leaders are also expected to be involved in company-wide events if/when the are available, and they should be prepared to help with promotion (inviting people to the events, putting up flyers) preparation (buying food, setting up decorations, etc.), and execution (meeting people at the door to greet them, directing people where to go, serving food, etc.).</p>\r\n<p>The last position affiliated with events is the Social Media and Marketing Manager, who will design the event poster beforehand, attend and take pictures during the event, make a blog or social post after the event, and distribute this post to the necessary channels. This person will also create the newsletter including the dates, times and descriptions of events, and links to last months events. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Event Request/Approval</h3>\r\n<p>Event&rsquo;s for each month are schedule, requested, and approved during the middle of the month before. So for example, events for the month of June are requested, and approved by the second to third week of May.</p>\r\n<p>To make a request, house leaders and community managers can go to the online to the current members portal and request to hold an event. Once all are submitted, Outpost Club management will approve the budget and send approvals to all house leader and community managers. The community manager is responsible for collecting the responses and getting approval from management.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Event Planning</h3>\r\n<p>Once events are approved, now it is time to start working on the specifics. All the information given in the event request form is subject to change. The time, date, budget, and even the event idea itself can change between when requested and when executed&hellip; And that&rsquo;s okay! However, this variability is why it is so important to plan as much as possible, as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<h4>Here are some essential questions House Leaders and Community Managers must answer.</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What can affect my events well-being?</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If it&rsquo;s an outdoor event, what\'s the weather?</li>\r\n<li>If it&rsquo;s a holiday event, who is going home for the holidays? Will people be around?</li>\r\n<li>If it had to be reschedule, when would it be rescheduled to?</li>\r\n<li>If its a ticketed event, when are tickets going to run out? What happens when they do? How do I notify members?</li>\r\n<li>How do I tell people who do not use facebook about my event?</li>\r\n<li>If the event is happening at your house, what happens if something else is going on in the space you want to hold your event in?</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>For this question, basically all you have to do is notify the house group chat that you will be using the space at a certain time</em>&gt;</li>\r\n<li>Who is coming to the event?</li>\r\n<li>What are you going to buy for the event and how are you going to buy it?</li>\r\n<li>What do I need from Outpost Club to complete this event successfully?</li>\r\n<li>Who will manage the event during the event? For example:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Who&rsquo;s cooking?</li>\r\n<li>Who is making drinks?</li>\r\n<li>Who will organize the mini events within the event?</li>\r\n<li>Who will set up decorations?</li>\r\n<li>Who will do the music?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Answering these questions will help you plan the event so that there is nothing to worry about once the event starts.</h4>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Event Promotion</h3>\r\n<p>This is arguably the most important part of the event. You can&rsquo;t have an event if no one shows up. Additionally, the more people at an event, the better! The community manager will create all the events and post them in the private facebook group for all current members to see. The event will also be created on the website so members without a facebook can still attend.</p>\r\n<p><strong>When creating the event digitally, the community manager must include:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Date</li>\r\n<li>Time</li>\r\n<li>Location</li>\r\n<li>Description of the event</li>\r\n<li>An event picture, designed by the Social Media Manager</li>\r\n<li>Associated prices for members, friends, and alumni<em> and a link to purchasing page</em></li>\r\n<li>Link to the website event page (from facebook) link to the facebook event page (from the website)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Event Execution</h3>\r\n<p>This is the fun part! This part includes making sure all the party supplies are purchased and organized, things are prepared (the grill is hot, the movie is purchased, ect.) and that YOU ARE PRESENT! Don&rsquo;t forget, you get to decide when the event starts and when it ends. A couple other things to remember when holding events:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Outpost Club does not provide alcohol for events, but members who can legally drink are more than welcome to bring alcohol</li>\r\n<li>If an event is being held in the common of the house, make sure to be respectful of people in the rooms adjacent to the common space. If the event goes past quiet hours, make sure to get permission of the people in those rooms.</li>\r\n<li>Friends of members are welcome to come to events, they just need to buy a ticket, no matter the event. This is because Outpost Club members have already paid for the event through their membership fee, and if their friend shows up, they have not. Same goes for Alumni, however their payment is reduced in comparison to friends who have never stayed with Outpost.</li>\r\n<li>Have fun at events, but also remember that you are the host. Don&rsquo;t drink too much, but have a good time! Others will see this and have a good time as well.</li>\r\n<li>If an event goes overtime and members at the house want to sleep, take the event to a bar or a public place! Nothing is stopping people from continuing to hang out, just make sure to be respectful of members&rsquo; sleep schedules.</li>\r\n<li>Go knock on peoples doors if the event is at home, or you are leaving from the house, you are sure to get some more people this way!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Event Reporting</h3>\r\n<p>Once the event is over, it&rsquo;s not done! There are some final things you&rsquo;ll need to do to complete the responsibility of holding an event:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fill out the event report. This will ask you to:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Answer questions on how the event went: what went well and what could be improved</li>\r\n<li>Report attendance</li>\r\n<li>Report expenditures, as well as the need for a refund from Outpost (if applicable)</li>\r\n<li>To send pictures of the event</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Lastly, if it makes sense, the Social Media Manager will write a piece on the event and post it to the blog and facebook groups! That way others will be encouraged to come to future events.</strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Company-Wide Events Versus House Events</h3>\r\n<p>At Out</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 12, '', '', '', '', 244, 1, 0, 0, 0, 'Event Process', 0, 0, 'a:0:{}', '', '', '', '', 0, '0.00000000', '0.00000000', 0, '', NULL),

All interior doors are locked with an August Lock. An August Lock is an electronic lock that uses an application called August that you can use to unlock it. Find it in the app store, create an account and ask your house leader to give you access.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>WiFi</h3>\r\n<p>As always, you&rsquo;ll need WiFi. The WiFi name is Outpost (or some variation of thereof) and the password is befreenyc (all lower case).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>ID</h3>\r\n<p>For our records and according to state law, we&rsquo;ll need a picture of your photo ID. Either a national ID or a passport will work. The house leader will take a picture of it when you move in.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Communication With Other Residents</h3>\r\n<p>We use Facebook messenger to communicate, so the house leader will need to add you to the group. If you don&rsquo;t have Facebook, please regularly check in with the house leader to see if there is important house news you need to know.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>See the House</h3>\r\n<p>The house leader will show you your room and give you a tour of the house (if they haven&rsquo;t already). Note your bed number, which can be found on your bed frame, or your room letter if you have a single room. If you would like to lock away your valuables, use the lockers in the basement. Outpost Club is not responsible for the safety of your valuables and we do not provide locks, just lockers.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Kitchen</h3>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need a section of the fridge, which is partitioned by area so that everyone has equal access. If you open the fridge, you&rsquo;ll see each section has a letter and a number corresponding with your bed. Use this area of the fridge for your items and talk to others in the house or to your house leader if you need more space. This goes for the cabinets as well: Find your section, which will be labeled by your bed number.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Events</h3>\r\n<p>Outpost Club will hold events at your place and at all Outpost Club locations, so make sure to ask the house leader about any upcoming events. Additionally, we have a Facebook group for all <a class=\"green\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/outpostclub/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Outpost Club members in New York</strong></a>.

That&rsquo;s Japantown.</p>\r\n<p>Our house in Japantown features two floors of exclusively designed spaces above a ground-level restaurant, and is a stone&rsquo;s throw away from plenty of dining and entertainment options. It has a large co-working space perfect for group brainstorms or solo projects, relaxing common spaces and everything you&rsquo;ll need to feel right at home from the moment you step inside. All you need to bring is your suitcase.</p>\r\n<p>This house is newly renovated, with hardwood floors and updated appliances. The kitchen and common areas are massive compared to the average San Francisco apartment, and there&rsquo;re multiple co-working tables in the common area, so you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about finding room to be productive.

Make sure to put your full address, including your outside door code, in the delivery field when you order something. You may find your package left inside the main door, concealed outside, with a roommate who picked it up for you or returned to a distribution center for a later delivery. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to track your packages and make sure you&rsquo;re home to receive them when necessary.</p>\r\n</div>', 1, '40.81492000', '-73.94439000', 492, '', NULL),

Watch the video below to see what you should recycle:</p>\r\n<iframe style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/EUyVELb5PzY\" width=\"70%\" height=\"400\"></iframe><br /><br />\r\n<p><strong>Cleanliness is also required.</strong> That&rsquo;s especially true of common areas, including shared rooms. Here are some easy ways to think about cleanliness at Outpost:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Leave rooms in the condition in which you found them</li>\r\n<li>Clean up after yourself</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t leave your belongings in the common area unless you&rsquo;re returning immediately</li>\r\n<li>Pay attention to the signs around the house: They&rsquo;re there to help our community run smoothly!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Outpost is not responsible for lost or damaged mail or packages.</strong> Your House Leader will check the mail regularly. Make sure to put your full address, including your outside door code, in the delivery field when you order something. You may find your package left inside the main door, concealed outside, with a roommate who picked it up for you or returned to a distribution center for a later delivery. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to track your packages and make sure you&rsquo;re home to receive them when necessary.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 2, '40.69659000', '-73.97474000', 495, '', '2022-09-07 08:26:54'),

We chose SoMa because it&rsquo;s conveniently located near Union Square and with easy access to BART and multiple Muni lines. The neighborhood itself is full of things to eat, see and do, as well as multiple grocery stores, and the commute downtown is a breeze.</p>\r\n<p>Our SoMa House consists of just four bedrooms, which promotes a sense of community among our members. The apartment is spacious, with a common kitchen and living room with a large table for co-working and a comfy couch for movie nights. It&rsquo;s the perfect place for professionals and students alike.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h6 class=\"h5\">The Neighborhood</h6>\r\n<p>This coliving house is located a stone&rsquo;s throw from downtown. With Union Square just 14 minutes away and a range of dining, drinking and entertainment options in walking distance, the location is ideal for both work and weekend leisure activities. The house is located near the UC Hastings College of Law and the San Francisco Public Library.</p>\r\n<p>The nearest Muni station is Van Ness on the K-Ingleside and T-Third lines, just a 5-minute walk from the house. You can be in Union Square in just 14 minutes (or walk in 29 minutes). The SoMa House is just a 15-minute walk to the Civic Center, where transit links including BART are available, and multiple bus lines serve the neighborhood.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h6 class=\"h5\">The space</h6>\r\n<p>This house is an intimate yet spacious, newly renovated space with hardwood floors and updated appliances. The kitchen and common areas are massive compared to the average San Francisco apartment, and furnished with everything you&rsquo;ll need for work and play.</p>\r\n<p><strong>This space is move-in ready; all you have to do is show up with your suitcase.</strong></p>\r\n</div>', 5, '', 'soma-house.jpg', 'soma-background.jpg', '', 532, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'The SoMa House', 0, 0, 'a:7:{i:0;O:8:\"stdClass\":3:{s:5:\"title\";s:20:\"Throughout the house\";s:4:\"type\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"body\";s:1495:\"<p>{throughout}</p>\r\n<table class=\"table v2\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<th class=\"title\">\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span class=\"gold\">Gold</span> Membership</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</th>\r\n<th colspan=\"2\">\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span class=\"silver\">Silver</span> Membership</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"bronze\">Bronze</span> Membership</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan=\"2\"><em>*Bronze members must move in on <strong>the first day</strong> of the month</em></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<th>1-12 Months</th>\r\n<th>4+ Months</th>\r\n<th>1-3 Months</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Private&nbsp;(Executive)</th>\r\n<td>$2050</td>\r\n<td>$2190</td>\r\n<td>$2250</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>2-people shared</th>\r\n<td>$990</td>\r\n<td>$1150</td>\r\n<td>$1190</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>4-people shared</th>\r\n<td>$790</td>\r\n<td>$950</td>\r\n<td>$990</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan=\"5\">See the benefits of Bronze, Silver, and Gold Membership <a class=\"red\" href=\"../memberships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>**The prices shown indicate <strong>the prices valid for move-in between June 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020</strong>.

We want to give you a quick update on how we plan to address potential cases of COVID-19 within our communities. We continue to closely monitor guidelines and regulations set by local, state and federal officials, as well as recommendations by the CDC and WHO.</p>\r\n<h3>Here\'s what we ask of all of our members as we navigate this pandemic together:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you begin experiencing symptoms or are tested for or confirmed to have COVID-19, stay in your unit and email <a class=\"green\" href=\"mailto:customer.service@outpost-club.com\" target=\"_blank\" data-hs-link-id=\"0\">customer.service@outpost-club.com</a>&nbsp;to let us know immediately. We\'ll protect your privacy.</li>\r\n<li>Continue to wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds upon entering the house and before/after touching high-contact surfaces like door knobs and handles.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Respect your housemates. Even if you don\'t feel like you\'re at risk for contacting COVID-19, <strong>it\'s your responsibility to follow all public health guidelines, including staying home as much as possible, so as not to put your housemates at risk.</strong> If you feel a housemate is unnecessarily putting your house at risk, please first talk to them, and let us know if the situation isn\'t resolved.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Here are the first steps we\'ll take if one of our community members reports a potential COVID-19 case:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We\'ll notify the other members of the unit immediately that someone in their unit may be ill.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Within 24 hours, we\'ll deliver masks, gloves, additional disinfectant and sanitizing chlorhexidine to the affected unit or house (subject to availability).</li>\r\n<li>We\'ll sanitize all common areas, including hallways, to reduce the risk of additional transmission.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong> If your symptoms are mild, health officials have asked that you don\'t go to the hospital. We recommend you stay in your unit and notify your relatives and Outpost. If you do need to go to the hospital or to a clinic, call the hospital first and explain that you\'re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms so they can prepare. If you are short of breath or have a very high fever, call 911.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We appreciate your understanding as we navigate this situation as it evolves.

Clean up after yourselves. Follow the trash schedule. Clean the bathroom after you use it.<br />It&rsquo;s not JUST about the coronavirus. We all must work together to make sure that healthy people stay healthy, and also to protect each other and not overwhelm the medical system. In other words, at this point it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s responsibility to keep our houses as clean as possible to avoid ANY illness, and it does start with everyone doing their part.</p>\r\n<h3>Maintenance</h3>\r\n<p>We will limit responses to maintenance requests to emergencies. If something happens, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out. But we won&rsquo;t be able to attend to routine things, so please make sure you use the house things responsibly and carefully. In the past we&rsquo;ve seen toilets clogged with paper towels and hygiene products. We&rsquo;ve cleaned bathroom drains of balls of hair and ... well, God knows what. We might not be able to send anyone to do this while restrictions are in place, so please be responsible tenants, and mindful of our limited ability to address minor issues. Again, if there&rsquo;s an actual emergency we will do our best to attend to it immediately or as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplies</h3>\r\n<p>We have created some supply reserve, so we should be good for some time in case there continue to be disruptions with deliveries. In the houses where we don&rsquo;t have a House Leader living on premises, however, <strong>we need volunteers who are willing to distribute a reasonable amount of supplies so we don&rsquo;t run out.</strong> If you feel like you can and want to do that, please do reach out to me (george@outpost-club.com) for additional information.</p>\r\n<h3>Outside guests and gatherings</h3>\r\n<p>We are not closing the common spaces in the houses. However, we are absolutely and strictly going to enforce a no-guest policy, as prescribed by Gov. Cuomo of New York: \"Nonessential gatherings of individuals of any size or for any reason are canceled or postponed.&rdquo; (NY Times)</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, Gov. Newsom of California has ordered all Californians to stay in their houses as much as possible, and Gov. Murphy of New Jersey will implement further restrictions this weekend. (NY Times)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Let me explain why this matters:</strong></p>\r\n<p>You and your friends may be in low-risk groups. You may both have strong immune systems and won&rsquo;t end up getting sick, but without knowing, you may both be carriers of the new coronavirus. So you open the door, they open the door, and the virus is now on that door knob. And then your housemate who isn&rsquo;t lucky to have a super strong immune system opens that door and is exposed to the virus ... You get the idea, and I&rsquo;m sure no one wants that on their conscience. I know it sucks not to be able to see your friends. It sucks not to live the life we took for granted. But the more responsible we are now &mdash; the more we sacrifice for everyone&rsquo;s well being now &mdash; the sooner things will go back to normal. <strong>So, please: no outside guests.</strong> No gatherings in the common areas unless you can ensure the suggested 3-6 ft distance. Please, do your part so that we all are safer.We all at Outpost are trying our best to make sure all of us, members and our team alike, stay healthy and stay safe. If there&rsquo;s something you believe we can do additionally, please do let us know, through your House Leader or by email.</p>\r\n<h3>Most importantly: Outpost is OUR home.

The current outbreak that is most often referred to as \"coronavirus\" is actually a recently discovered coronavirus that causes a disease called COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>How can I protect myself from coronavirus?&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>The simple answer here is to practice basic hygiene, <a class=\"green\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to WHO</a>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stay at&nbsp;least&nbsp;1&ndash;3 feet away from someone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>\r\n<li>Wash your hands with soap and water regularly, and use hand sanitizer when hand-washing isn\'t an option.</li>\r\n<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>\r\n<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>\r\n<li>Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. If you use a tissue, wash your hands afterward.</li>\r\n<li>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, go to the doctor early.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At this time, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio is urging&nbsp;New Yorkers to <strong>avoid crowded subway cars and wait for the next train if cars are full</strong>, <a class=\"green\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/nyregion/coronavirus-newyork.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to The New York Times</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Do I need to get a&nbsp;face&nbsp;mask?&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Unless you\'re actually sick, <a class=\"green\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-n95-face-masks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>no, it is not advised to buy a face mask</strong></a>. According to the Surgeon General and the medical community around the world, face masks aren\'t effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus. Additionally,&nbsp;with everyone out buying up all the face masks, we\'re actually putting medical professionals who actually need them at risk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Is it safe to receive mail from China, Italy or other countries facing an outbreak?</h2>\r\n<p><a class=\"green\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to WHO</a>, yes, it is safe. People receiving packages from China, Italy and other affected locations are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. Coronaviruses do not survive long on objects like letters and packages.</p>\r\n<h2>What will Outpost do?&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Right now, the most important thing we can do is urge our members to follow the advice in this email to keep coronavirus at bay. We encourage you to wash your hands as soon as you get home every day, and to practice good hygiene out of respect for your housemates.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the only change we\'re making to our operations is scaling back plans for larger community events, for our members\' peace of mind. We will also adjust things in compliance with any requirements put in place by New York City, the state of New York or the federal government.

Here are some easy ways to think about cleanliness at Outpost:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Leave rooms in the condition in which you found them</li>\r\n<li>Clean up after yourself</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t leave your belongings in the common area unless you&rsquo;re returning immediately</li>\r\n<li>Pay attention to the signs around the house: They&rsquo;re there to help our community run smoothly!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Outpost is not responsible for lost or damaged mail or packages.</strong> Your House Leader will check the mail regularly. Make sure to put your full address, including your outside door code, in the delivery field when you order something. You may find your package left inside the main door, concealed outside, with a roommate who picked it up for you or returned to a distribution center for a later delivery. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to track your packages and make sure you&rsquo;re home to receive them when necessary.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 2, '40.68896080', '-73.95070581', 490, '', '2022-08-22 13:21:51'),

Watch the video below to see what you should recycle:</p>\r\n<iframe style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/EUyVELb5PzY\" width=\"70%\" height=\"400\"></iframe><br /><br />\r\n<p><strong>Cleanliness is also required.</strong> That&rsquo;s especially true of common areas, including shared rooms. Here are some easy ways to think about cleanliness at Outpost:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Leave rooms in the condition in which you found them</li>\r\n<li>Clean up after yourself</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t leave your belongings in the common area unless you&rsquo;re returning immediately</li>\r\n<li>Pay attention to the signs around the house: They&rsquo;re there to help our community run smoothly!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Outpost is not responsible for lost or damaged mail or packages.</strong> Your House Leader will check the mail regularly. Make sure to put your full address, including your outside door code, in the delivery field when you order something. You may find your package left inside the main door, concealed outside, with a roommate who picked it up for you or returned to a distribution center for a later delivery. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to track your packages and make sure you&rsquo;re home to receive them when necessary.</p>\r\n</div>', 2, '40.70048000', '-73.91977000', 496, '', '2022-07-11 06:30:31'),
